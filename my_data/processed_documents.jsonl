Ms Kerstin Pürschel Ambassador, Permanent Delegate Permanent Delegation of Germany to UNESCO 9, rue Maspéro Paris 75116 World Heritage List 202 4 Moravian Church Settlements Germany  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland  United States of America  Interim report and additional information request Dear Ambassador, As prescribed by the Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention and its Annex 6, the Advisory Bodies are requested to submit a short interim report for each nomination by 31 January 2024. We are therefore pleased to provide you with the relevant information outlining issues related to the evaluation procedure. The ICOMOS technical evaluation mission to the Moravian Church Settlements  was carried out by Mr. Nils Ahlberg Sweden between the end of July and beginning of August 2023. The mission expert highly appreciated the availabilities and support provided by the experts in your country for the organisation and implementation of the mission. On 4 October 2023, an additional information letter was sent by ICOMOS to request further information regarding history and development, maps and plans showing the boundaries of the nominated property and buffer zone, the delineation of buffer zones, and legal protectio n. Please convey our thanks to all the officials and experts for the additional information you provided on 3 and 5 November 2023 and for their continued cooperation in this process. At the end of November 2023, the ICOMOS World Heritage Panel evaluated the cultural and mixed properties nominated for inscription on the World Heritage List in 2024. The additional information provided by the States Parties , together with mission and desk review reports were carefully examined by the Panel members. This process will conclude in March 2024. We thank you and your Delegation for your availability and your participation in the meeting held on 24 November 202 3 with some representatives of the ICOMOS Panel. The exchanges during this meeting were of great help for the third part of the ICOMOS Panel meeting. During this last part of the meeting, the Panel has identified areas where it considers that further information is needed. Therefore, we would be pleased if the States Parties could consider the following points Comparative analysis ICOMOS acknowledges the comparative analysis provided in the nomination dossier and the annex on the Moravian Church settlements and Moravian Church missions inventory , which gives a broad context and shows at the same time the extent and diversity of the phenomenon of the Moravian settlement s. It is clear from the comparative analysis that, in addition to the proposed extension compri sing three settlements, there are other sites which comply with the parameters adopted and the criteria established for comparison but which, for various reasons , are not included in the current nomination. Nevertheless, t he proposed extension is presented as a complete ensemble illustrating , together with Christiansfeld, the phenomenon of the Moravian Church Settlements in a comprehensive manner. At the same time, the States Parties mention that there might be additions to the nominated property in the future. ICOMOS would appreciate if the States Parties could comment on this issue and provide additional information on potential future extension that would enrich the illustration of the phenomenon of the Moravian Church Settlements . Description of the nominated property Herrnhut, Bethlehem and Gracehill, t he three nominated component parts, in combination with Christiansfeld, illustrate different facets and stages of development of the phenomenon of the Moravian Church Settlements, which is considered in the nomination dossier as part of the justification for inscription. The description of the colonisation process and spatial development of an unparalleled international network of ideal settlements planned and constructed by the Moravian Church in Europe and North America  nomination dossier, p.13 and the individual settlements within the network seem crucial to understand the phenomenon. ICOMOS would appreciate if the States Parties could provide a summary explaining the most important principles , motives, directions and developments of the Moravian settlement s, in order to better understand the broader context of the individual nominated settlements. Additional information on the structure of the network and the links between the settlements within the proposed extension, and more widely with other settlement s within the represented network , as well as information on typological groups , would provide a better understanding of this network , both historically and from a contemporary perspective. The continuation of Moravian Church activities and traditions  nomination dossier, p.13 is recognised as one of the attributes supporting the value of the nominated component parts and of the nominated property as a whole . At the same time, it is claimed that the continuing presence of Moravian Church communities in each settlement ties the historic structures to the ongoing life of the larger Moravian Church community p.13 . On page 15 of the nomination dossier there is a reference to intangibles but the information provided is limited. ICOMOS would appreciate to receive additional information on Moravian traditions present within the nominated property , especially those that are not directly related to the practice of religion by the communities in the nominated component parts , as well as a presentation on distinct traditions  present in the three nominated component parts. Information on continuing practices and existing traditional craftsmen skills would also be of particular interest . In addition, ICOMOS would be pleased if the States Parties could consider to provide additional information on the heritage features mentioned below , to present a more complete and understandable picture of the historic Moravian Church Settlements   For Herrnhut - Pilgerhaus built in 1864 for visiting missionaries - Common Laundry House from 1788 now called Alte Rolle .  For Bethlehem - Second Single Brethrens House built in 1744  - Schnitz Haus erected in 1801 for cutting and drying apples  - Monocacy Creek , a tributary of the Lehigh River . ICOMOS would also appreciate to receive information on other existing buildings or sites constituting Moravian heritage that are included within the boundaries of the nominated component parts or their respective buffer zones . Information on their protection and how they are included, or planned to be included in the presentation of Moravian heritage, would also be of interest . Boundaries ICOMOS notes that the partial character of the inventories and the lack of urban studies make it difficult to understand the layout of the nominated settlements, their development and, consequently, the proposed delineation of the boundaries, especially as they appear to have been conceived according to different approaches. ICOMOS would therefore welcome a brief explanation on the rationale underlying the delineation of the boundaries of the nominated component parts. In addition, ICOMOS would also like to know whether the States Parties would consider some possible clarification or revision of the proposed boundaries to include all key elements of the historic spatial structure of the settlements , particularly   For Herrnhut  ICOMOS would appreciate if the State Party could clarify the boundary delineation at the northwest end, around the Ethnographic Museum and its modern extension.  For Bethlehem ICOMOS notes that a different approach to the delineation of the boundaries was applied in the case of Bethlehem which, as it is understood, has its source in the national legal framework and requirements for World Heritage nominations . Nevertheless, as it has an impact on the integrity of the nominated component part , ICOMOS considers that the inclusion of the Second Single Brethrens House as well as the Schnitz House is crucial , and would like to ask the State Party to consider revising the proposed boundaries to include the mentioned buildings . It is argued in the nomination dossier that topography had an impact on the location and layout of the settlement in Bethlehem. Therefore, i t would also be important to include the Monocacy Creek as well as other buildings, gardens and functional areas located currently beyond the National Historic Landmark District boundaries which have an impact on the legibility of the history of the settlement its presentation and support the value, integrity and authenticity of the nominated component part. ICOMOS would appreciate if the State Party could provide practical and functional justification for the delineation of the boundaries through existing buildings , as well as clarification regarding the boundary between the Moravian building clustercomplex and the Gods Acre. This information would help to better understand the rationale behind it. According to the historic maps provided with the additional information sent in November 2023, the green area adjured to the Gods Acre to the east seems to be part of it . ICOMOS would appreciate clarification in this respect.  For Gracehill ICOMOS would appreciate if the State Party could consider the possibility to exten d the boundary of the nominated component part down to the River M aine, along the whole northern boundary or at least in front of the Central Square to include the area which form an important view along the central axis . Protection of the setting s and delineation of buffer zones ICOMOS acknowledges the clarifications provided on the delineation of the buffer zones . In light of this information, changes to the proposed boundaries of the buffer zones would be advisable , as follow  For Herrnhut Taking into account the importance of the Berthelsdorf Manor complex and its historic and functional connection with the village of Berthelsdorf , ICOMOS would be pleased if the State Part y could consider extending the buffer zone of this part of the nominated component part to the north as well as to the southeast and east .  For Bethlehem ICOMOS would appreciate if the State Party could consider extending the proposed buffer zone to the south down to the Lehigh River , as well as the possibility to extend its west boundary further out.  For Gracehill ICOMOS would appreci ate if the State Party could consider a small enlargement of the buffer zone to the west side of the south angle of the buffer zone, as well as the inclusion of the trees along the south side of Galgorm Road northern boundary and Nursery Road  south- eastern boundary , and to expand the southwest and north boundary further out. ICOMOS would also be pleased if the States Parties could provide additional information on the mechanisms for planning and controlling changes in the settings of the nominated settlements, particularly in relation to important views and functional relationships within the l andscape contexts. ICOMOS would be grateful if the States Parties could provide a response about whether each of the above- mentioned suggestions of modifications to boundariesbuffer zones could be implemented. Please provide revised maps for all completed and planned revisions to the boundaries and buffer zones, including the timeline for completion if these processes are ongoing by the deadline established for ICOMOS to receive additional information. Development projects  For Bethlehem  ICOMOS welcomes the information provided on the Skyline West development project. It would be helpful if the results of the Heritage Impact Assessment of this project could be provided for evaluation. Information on the mitigation measures proposed in case of negative impacts would also be of interest for ICOMOS.  For Gracehill The Wrightbus factory is located in the immediate vicinity of the nominated component part and there is no designated buffer zone between it and the settlement established. ICOMOS would appreciate to receive the results of the I mpact Assessment of the current and future impacts of the factory on the Moravian settlement of Gracehill . State of conservation and conservation measures ICOMOS considers that a conservation programme based on inventories and technical analyses which include built heritage, green areas and open fields shall be developed and implemented to ensure the preservation of the values of the nominated property, as well as its authenticity and integrity. It should encompass both the principal attributes as selected and described in the nomination dossier, as well as other key heritage features within the proposed boundaries. ICOMOS would appreciate if additional information on existing comprehensive conservation programmes and maintenance guidance developed for the nominated component parts could be provided. In case this is work in progress, information on a timeframe for their development and implementation would be welcome. ICOMOS notes that cement mixture mortar and plastic paint were used. The replacement of windows, doors and other details by copies or new types is also apparent in all the nominated component parts. ICOMOS would be pleased if the States Parties could comment on this aspect.  For Herrnhut The Berthelsdorf Manor complex, its buildings, green spaces and open areas public realm, have suffered from neglect for a long time and, in some cases, are still not in a good condition. ICOMOS would appreciate to receive detailed information on its current state of conservation, including inventory and technical assessment supported by a relevant conservation plan or programme. Similarly, a relevant conservation plan or programme would be appreciated for Vogtshof and the forest park behind the building. Managem ent ICOMOS would appreciate to receive indications as regards the timeframe for the completion and adoption of the individual local management plans . In addition, ICOMOS considers that the impacts of climate change need to be understood and sustainably managed. As such, ICOMOS would appreciate if the States Parties could elaborate on how climate change will be managed in each of the nominated component parts . W e look forward to your responses to these points, which will be of great help in our evaluation procedure. W e would be grateful if you could provide ICOMOS and the World Heritage Centre with the above requested information by 28 February 202 4 at the late st, the deadline set out in paragraph 148 of the Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention concerning additional information on nominations to be received. Please note that any information submitted after this statutory deadline will not be considered by ICOMOS in its evaluation for the World Heritage Committee. It should be noted, however, that while ICOMOS will carefully consider any additional information submitted within the statutory deadline, it will not be possibl e to properly evaluate a completely revised nomination or a large amount of new information submitted at the last minute. ICOMOS would therefore be grateful if the State Party could keep its response concise and respond only to the above requests. W e thank you for your support of the World Heritage Convention and the e valuation procedure.

According to the historic maps provided with the additional information sent in November 2023, the green area adjured to the Gods Acre to the east seems to be part of it . ICOMOS would appreciate clarification in this respect.  For Gracehill ICOMOS would appreciate if the State Party could consider the possibility to exten d the boundary of the nominated component part down to the River M aine, along the whole northern boundary or at least in front of the Central Square to include the area which form an important view along the central axis . Protection of the setting s and delineation of buffer zones ICOMOS acknowledges the clarifications provided on the delineation of the buffer zones . In light of this information, changes to the proposed boundaries of the buffer zones would be advisable , as follow  For Herrnhut Taking into account the importance of the Berthelsdorf Manor complex and its historic and functional connection with the village of Berthelsdorf , ICOMOS would be pleased if the State Part y could consider extending the buffer zone of this part of the nominated component part to the north as well as to the southeast and east .  For Bethlehem ICOMOS would appreciate if the State Party could consider extending the proposed buffer zone to the south down to the Lehigh River , as well as the possibility to extend its west boundary further out.  For Gracehill ICOMOS would appreci ate if the State Party could consider a small enlargement of the buffer zone to the west side of the south angle of the buffer zone, as well as the inclusion of the trees along the south side of Galgorm Road northern boundary and Nursery Road  south- eastern boundary , and to expand the southwest and north boundary further out. ICOMOS would also be pleased if the States Parties could provide additional information on the mechanisms for planning and controlling changes in the settings of the nominated settlements, particularly in relation to important views and functional relationships within the l andscape contexts. ICOMOS would be grateful if the States Parties could provide a response about whether each of the above- mentioned suggestions of modifications to boundariesbuffer zones could be implemented.

Information on the mitigation measures proposed in case of negative impacts would also be of interest for ICOMOS.  For Gracehill The Wrightbus factory is located in the immediate vicinity of the nominated component part and there is no designated buffer zone between it and the settlement established. ICOMOS would appreciate to receive the results of the I mpact Assessment of the current and future impacts of the factory on the Moravian settlement of Gracehill . State of conservation and conservation measures ICOMOS considers that a conservation programme based on inventories and technical analyses which include built heritage, green areas and open fields shall be developed and implemented to ensure the preservation of the values of the nominated property, as well as its authenticity and integrity. It should encompass both the principal attributes as selected and described in the nomination dossier, as well as other key heritage features within the proposed boundaries. ICOMOS would appreciate if additional information on existing comprehensive conservation programmes and maintenance guidance developed for the nominated component parts could be provided. In case this is work in progress, information on a timeframe for their development and implementation would be welcome. ICOMOS notes that cement mixture mortar and plastic paint were used. The replacement of windows, doors and other details by copies or new types is also apparent in all the nominated component parts. ICOMOS would be pleased if the States Parties could comment on this aspect.  For Herrnhut The Berthelsdorf Manor complex, its buildings, green spaces and open areas public realm, have suffered from neglect for a long time and, in some cases, are still not in a good condition. ICOMOS would appreciate to receive detailed information on its current state of conservation, including inventory and technical assessment supported by a relevant conservation plan or programme. Similarly, a relevant conservation plan or programme would be appreciated for Vogtshof and the forest park behind the building. Managem ent ICOMOS would appreciate to receive indications as regards the timeframe for the completion and adoption of the individual local management plans . In addition, ICOMOS considers that the impacts of climate change need to be understood and sustainably managed.

We are therefore pleased to provide you with the relevant information outlining issues related to the evaluation procedure. The ICOMOS technical evaluation mission to the Moravian Church Settlements  was carried out by Mr. Nils Ahlberg Sweden between the end of July and beginning of August 2023.

Please convey our thanks to all the officials and experts for the additional information you provided on 3 and 5 November 2023 and for their continued cooperation in this process. At the end of November 2023, the ICOMOS World Heritage Panel evaluated the cultural and mixed properti es nominated for inscription on the World Heritage List in 2024. The additional information provided by the States Parties , together with mission and desk review reports were carefully examined by the Panel members. This process will conclude in March 2024. We thank you and your Delegation for your availability and your participation in the meeting held on 24 November 202 3 with some representatives of the ICOMOS Panel. The exchanges during this meeting were of great help for the third part of the ICOMOS Panel meeting. During this last part of the meeting, the Panel has identified areas where it considers that further information is needed. Therefore, we would be pleased if the States Parties could consider the following points Comparative analysis ICOMOS acknowledges the comparative analysis provided in the nomination dossier and the annex on the Moravian Church settlements and Moravian Church missions inventory , which gives a broad context and shows at the same time the extent and diversity of the phenomenon of the Moravian settlement s.

Description of the nominated property Herrnhut, Bethlehem and Gracehill, t he three nominated component parts, in combination with Christiansfeld, illustrate different facets and stages of development of the phenomenon of the Moravian Church Settlements, which is considered in the nomination dossier as part of the justification for inscription.

On page 15 of the nomination dossier there is a reference to intangibles but the information provided is limited.

ICOMOS would therefore welcome a brief explanation on the rationale underlying the delineation of the boundaries of the nominated component parts. In addition, ICOMOS would also like to know whether the States Parties would consider some possible clarification or revision of the proposed boundaries to include all key elements of the historic spatial structure of the settlements , particularly   For Herrnhut  ICOMOS would appreciate if the State Party could clarify the boundary delineation at the northwest end, around the Ethnographic Museum and its modern extension. For Bethlehem ICOMOS notes that a different approach to the delineation of the boundaries was applied in the case of Bethlehem which, as it is understood, has its source in the national legal framework and requirements for World Heritage nominations . Nevertheless, as it has an impact on the integrity of the nominated component part , ICOMOS considers that the inclusion of the Second Single Brethrens House as well as the Schnitz House is crucial , and would like to ask the State Party to consider revising the proposed boundaries to include the mentioned buildings . It is argued in the nomination dossier that topography had an impact on the location and layout of the settlement in Bethlehem. Therefore, i t would also be important to include the Monocacy Creek as well as other buildings, gardens and functional areas located currently beyond the National Historic Landmark District boundaries which have an impact on the legibility of the history of the settlement its presentation and support the value, integrity and authenticity of the nominated component part.", "tokens": 359}, {"chunk_id": "1468bis-2554-interim_report-en_chunk_21", "original_index": 21, "content": "ICOMOS would appreciate if the State Party could provide practical and functional justification for the delineation of the boundaries through existing buildings , as well as clarification regarding the boundary between the Moravian building clustercomplex and the Gods Acre.

For Gracehill ICOMOS would appreciate if the State Party could consider the possibility to exten d the boundary of the nominated component part down to the River M aine, along the whole northern boundary or at least in front of the Central Square to include the area which form an important view along the central axis . Protection of the setting s and delineation of buffer zones ICOMOS acknowledges the clarifications provided on the delineation of the buffer zones .

The Committee inscribed 26 new cultural and natural properties on UNESCOs World Heritage List. The session concluded with Nauru ratifying the World Heritage Convention and becoming its 196th State Party. The Committee inscribed 26 new properties, including making 2 major extensions to properties which are considered as new inscriptions. The other inscriptions include 20 cultural properties, 5 natural properties and 1 mixed site. These properties thus benef it from the highest level of heritage protection in the world. Their managers will now have access to new opportunities for technical and financial assistance from UNESCO. These inscriptions bring the total number of properties inscribed on UNESCOs World Heritage List to 1223, in 168 countries. The Committee also examined the state of conservation of 123 other properties already inscribed on the World Heritage List. Several States Parties to the Convention - Colombia, Mauritius, the Lao Peoples Democratic Republic and the United Republic of Tanzania - have been allocated additional funds amounting to 235,520 , to finance new conservation work on properties on their territory. This new work will be added to the 22 International Assistance requests already approved since the beginning of the year, for a total amount of 695,201 dollars, in Africa, Asia -Pacific, the Arab States, Latin America and the Caribbean - all testimony to th e work UNESCO and its partners are doing around the world to preserve of our common heritage.

Further information about the Committee is available here. The Protection of heritage at risk and the duty to collaborate with local communities During this session, the Committee recognized the urgent need to strengthen the protection of several properties that are under potential or actual threat. To this end, the Committee inscribed the Monastery of Saint HilarionTell Umm Amer in Palestine, simultaneously on both the World Heritage List and the List of World Heritage in Danger, and reiterated its calls for the protection of properties already inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger, particularly in Ukraine. The World Heritage Committee also once again demonstrated its commitment to putting local people at the heart of the process of protecting World Heritage, inscribing sites such as Te Henua Enata  The Marquises Islands of France, the Via Appia. Regina Viarum in Italy, and the Royal Court of Tiébélé in Burkina Faso. The examination of the state of conservation of many properties already inscribed also served to remind the States Parties of their duty to guarantee full respect for human rights, and ensuring local and indigenous people are placed at the heart of all man agement and conservation strategies. Continuing to promote African heritage In keeping with the UNESCO Director -Generals policy of prioritizing African heritage, 5 new sites on the continent were inscribed on the World Heritage List the Nelson Mandela memorial sites and the Pleistocene occupation sites in South Africa , the Royal Court of Tiébélé in Burkina Faso, the archaeological and palaeontological sites of Ethiopias High Plateaux region, and the historic town and archaeological site of Gedi in Kenya. This session of the Committee also saw the removal of the Niokolo Koba National Park in Senegal from the List of World Heritage in Danger , thanks to the joint efforts to reduce threats to the site, made by the Senegalese authorities in collaboration with local communities, and with the support of UNESCO. Kenya announced its desire to host an international conference in Nairobi, in May 2025, to enable an in - depth reflection on the concept of authenticity in African heritage, and to increase African sites representation on the World Heritage List. Finally, India, which successfully hosted this session of the Committee, announced a contribution of 1 million to UNESCOs World Heritage Centre to support the safeguarding of World Heritage in Africa and in Small Island Developing States in Asia, through training programmes, technical assistance and conservation.

In fact, thebelief that World Heritage sites belong to everyone and should be preserved for future generations isthe very principle on which the World Heritage Convention is based. So how do we merge our convic-tions with our concerns over the impact of tourism on World Heritage sites? The answer is through sustainable tourism. Directing governments, site managers and visitors towards sustainable tourismpractices is the only way to ensure the safekeeping of our worlds natural and cultural heritage. In 2002, the international communitys virtually undivided attention was focused on tourism and its impact on our cultural and natural heritage. It started with the United Nations declaration of 2002 as theYear for Cultural Heritage. Then in May, Québec City hosted the first ever World Ecotourism Summit,whose Declaration on the development of Ecotourism in the context of sustainable development waslater delivered at the Johannesburg World Summit. In November, heritage, tourism and developmentis one of the focuses of the International Congress in Venice on the occasion of the 30th anniversary ofthe World Heritage Convention. Through the publication of this manual, we aim to harness this momen-tum by putting all of the ideas, theories and plans for sustainable tourism into action. By learning to tread lightly on the earth, not only are we ensuring the future of World Heritage sites but also the future of tourism. Its a win-win situation for everyone involved the site is better protect-ed and maintained, the tourist experiences a more pleasant visit, and the local economy is boosted as aresult. Tourism is an important management issue at both natural and cultural World Heritage sites. It is an industry with well-known costs but also with the potential for aiding protection efforts. We recognizethis potential and are convinced that by engaging, and by taking appropriate actions at the different levels of the sustainable tourism process, tourism can be managed to generate net site benefits. Thismanual outlines a process to guide site managers toward this end. The first in a series of how to World Heritage manuals, it is dedicated to the men and women who give their heart and soul everyday to protecting our worlds priceless treasures. Finally, I thank TEMA and UNEP for supporting the Centres initiative to elaborate a user-friendly Manual for World Heritage Site Managers. Francesco Bandarin Director, UNESCO, World Heritage CentreParis, FranceForeword 3WH  manual1-intro 311002 1402 Page 3 I am proud to present this manual, another valuable contribution to the International Year of Ecotourism in 2002. Tourism is one of the worlds largest industries, with almost 700 million international tourists in2002, and can become an essential tool in the challenge to overcome biodiversity losses and eradicatepoverty, particularly in sensitive ecosystems and protected areas. The basic fact is that a healthy socialand natural environment is the first and most important asset for this global industry. It makes businesssense for tourism stakeholders to be natural allies of sustainability. Protected areas, particularly World Heritage sites, are some of tourisms main attractions, and are subject to growing visitation. World Heritage sites are outstanding cultural and natural landscapes covering allkinds of ecosystems, which are carefully selected through a process resulting from a 1972 multilateralagreement involving 175 countries. Maintaining such sites requires adequate practices to guaranteeenvironmentally sound management of the park and at the same time to ensure that local communitiesbenefit from the parks existence. The potential economic benefits that tourism can bring do not materialize without careful planning. Indeed, uncontrolled tourism development can have major negative impacts on these jewels of human-itys heritage. World Heritage site managers are often inadequately prepared to deal with the challengesof visitation and to negotiate with the complex tourism industry. Their background most often lies inforestry, public environmental management and biological sciences. Thus, concepts such as businessmanagement, marketing, and entrepreneurial risk management are still relatively new to many site man-agers. A practical, case-specific approach is used in the manual to explain these and other subjects, sothat park managers can design and develop visitation according to the needs and limits of a sites master plans. In 2002, UNEP, IUCN and the World Tourism Organization published a book entitled Sustainable Tourism in Protected Areas written by Dr. Paul Eagles of the World Commission on Protected Areas, with the contribution of many other international experts. This book aims at building a better understanding ofissues related to tourism in protected areas and providing guidelines on how to address them. The pres-ent manual effectively complements the previous publication it addresses the specific needs of WorldHeritage site managers and guides them through the visitor planning and management process. It is onemore milestone in UNEPs long collaboration with UNESCO on improving benefits to protected areasthrough sustainable tourism. I am sure it will result in increased cooperation and partnerships amongWorld Heritage site managers, the tourism industry, local communities, governments and travelers. Jacqueline Aloisi de Larderel Assistant Executive DirectorDirector, Division of Technology, Industry and Economics, United Nations Environment ProgrammeForeword 5WH  manual1-intro 311002 1402 Page 5 It can be easy with all the other tourism manuals around to ask why write another. This of course is a legitimate question that should be addressed by the author. The answer is quite simple this manual comes out of a desire to see just what is being done in the field, trying to make sense of it all, comparing it to my own experience, and putting what I learned in a style oflanguage hopefully everyone can understand. Having worked in visitor management and planning formany years, I wanted to know what we have discovered in using tourism as a tool to benefit conservation. In fact this manual is just the start of a projected series of manuals for World Heritage site managers on tourism issues. Why the focus on World Heritage sites? Perhaps this is best explained by a question fromthe Chief of the Natural Heritage Section of the World Heritage Centre, Natarajan Ishwaran, who onceasked, If we cant save World Heritage sites, what can we save? I have taken this to heart. As I continueto work with World Heritage sites I have come to realize the important role of the World HeritageConvention. What this manual does, and why it may be different than others, is that it synthesizes the logical and holistic process of tourism and visitor management reflected in management literature. It has been myexperience that if one understands the process of a subject and has a global vision of how things fittogether, it is much easier to wade through the array of technical details that compose most modernfields. Without this knowledge, those who arent specialists can get lost in the complexity. Successful, sustainable tourism calls for a process of close engagement. It involves having clear ideas on goals and objectives, knowing where you want to go, setting these goals and objectives within the constraints of legal and social rules and then negotiating with relevant interest groups to try to incor-porate their needs into the mix. It also means continually monitoring to see if these elusive targets arebeing reached and, if they are not, deciding what actions to take to get the programme back on track.This whole process is simple in theory but difficult to implement and sustain in practice. Someone once said to me that, Ideas should feel like affinities and not impositions, and I have tried, with the help of my fine editor Gina Dogget to gear the text to this end.

The World Travel and Tourism Council WTTC estimates that tourism generates some 12 of the world total GNP . With studies predicting continued growth, tourism is anincreasingly important factor in the planning and management at UNESCO World Heritage sites. While no formal data have been collected, a sites inscription on the World Heritage List often coincides with a boost in visitation rates. Even at current rates, tourism is an important issue at World Heritage sites. A 1993 UNESCO-United Nations Environmental Programme UNEP study showed that most managers of natural sites regard it as akey issue. Interviews and surveys carried out by the World Heritage Centre at cultural sites have revealed similarconcerns. Tourism offers well-known advantages. Visitor fees, concessions and donations provide funds for restoration and protection efforts. Visitors may be recruited as friends of a site and can help generate international support. Touroperators and hotel chains can play a role in the management of a site by making financial contributions, aidingmonitoring efforts, or instructing their clients in responsible tourism. Tourism can also promote cultural values bysupporting local handicrafts or by offering alternative economic activities. On the downside, tourism spawns well-known problems. Managing rapid tourism growth is a time-consuming process demanding clear policies, ongoing dialogue with stakeholders, and constant monitoring. Tourism activitiesrequire environmental impact assessments EIAs and procedures for minimising impacts. At sites with limited budgets and staff, growing tourism can stretch scarce resources and take managers away from protection efforts. While tourism can contribute to protection and restoration efforts, the right balance between economic gain and undesirable impacts can be elusive. Managers know that a tourist attraction must be periodically renewed to remaincompetitive. In the case of World Heritage sites, they are also aware that they are under an international obligationto maintain or restore the sites original values. This responsibility poses difficult questions regarding the degree ofchange that should be permitted to accommodate tourism growth. Another problem is ensuring that a portion oftourism revenue remains in the community as a means of fostering local protection, conservation and restorationefforts. To meet these and other challenges, managers have requested training and information on World Heritage as well as concrete examples of procedures for addressing tourism planning issues. The World Heritage Centre has respon-ded by increasing its support for training in tourism management skills, including the publication of this manual. The manual addresses the needs identified by site managers and training centres. It provides a set of management methodologies and practices intended to help managers to solve tourism problems. It also establishes a commonterminology with the aim of facilitating communication and information exchange among managers. Subjects includeUNESCO, the World Heritage Convention and the World Heritage Centre, the tourism industry, working with thepublic, carrying capacity issues, tourism impacts, visitor management strategies, and interpretation and promotionseveral of these subjects are illustrated by short case studies. The manual also offers a set of tools applicable to designing surveys, monitoring policy and management imple- mentation, promoting sites and communicating with stakeholders. Managers can select the procedures that areappropriate for different sites, and adapt them accordingly.Introduction  11WH  manual1-intro 311002 1402 Page 11 Readers will note that the manual addresses tourism at both cultural and natural sites. While visitor management poses different issues depending on whether a site is cultural or natural, the two types of sites have many concernsin common, including setting goals and objectives, working with stakeholders, dealing with issues of carrying capa-city, and interpretation and promotional activities. Moreover, many World Heritage sites, though listed as eithernatural or cultural, protect both types of resources. Experience has shown that visitor management is a balancing act requiring the establishment of a tourism policy based on conservation and preservation goals that will be supported by all stakeholders, while respecting legal man-dates, encouraging ongoing debate and monitoring tourism activities. This manual attempts to bring these manyfactors together, to provide managers with a practical framework on which to base their efforts. 12WH  manual1-intro 311002 1402 Page 12 The World Heritage Convention Galàpagos Islands, Equador  UNESCOWHC 13WH  manual1-ch1 311002 1435 Page 1 The World Heritage Convention 14An understanding of the responsibilities assumed under the World Heritage Convention is essential topolicy setting and decision making. The OperationalGuidelines accompanying the Convention have alarge bearing on tourism management, providinguseful guidance on responsibilities such as periodicreporting. The World Heritage network also offers unique opportunities, and the World HeritageCentre has an array of resources available to tourismmanagers including public information materials. 1.1 The World Heritage Convention 1.1.1 The Convention Concerning the Protection ofthe World Cultural and Natural Heritage, signed inParis on November 16, 1972, is an internationalagreement through which nations join together toconserve a collection of the worlds timeless treas-ures. Each country, or State Party to the Convention recognises its primary duty to ensure the identification, protection, conservation and transmission to future gen-erations of the cultural and natural heritage situated on itsterritory. To date, more than 170 States Parties have signed the World Heritage Convention, making it one of the most powerful protection instruments in the world. It is the onlyinternational legal instrument for the protection of bothcultural and natural sites encouraging cooperation amongnations for safeguarding their heritage. 1.1.2 The intergovernmental World Heritage Committee includes 21 States Parties elected for aterm of six years by the General Assembly of theStates Parties to the World Heritage Convention.The Committee is responsible for implementing theConvention and determines which sites to include on theWorld Heritage List based on the recommendations of two advisory bodies the International Council onMonuments and Sites ICOMOS for cultural sites, and theWorld Conservation Union IUCN for natural sites. A third advisory body, the International Centre for the Study ofthe Preservation and Restoration of Cultural PropertyICCROM, provides expert advice on monument restora-tion and the management of cultural heritage. It alsoorganises training for specialists. The six member Bureau of the World Heritage Committee, which helps the Committee to interpret theConvention, meets twice a year to evaluate requests forsite inscriptions and financial assistance. The Committeeand its Bureau examine state of conservation reportsregarding sites already inscribed on the World Heritage List. Both the Committee and the Bureau make recom-mendations to States Parties on site conservation and pro-vide technical or financial assistance, as appropriate andwithin the available budget, to ensure the protection ofthe integrity and authenticity of sites.Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage EXCERPTS ... in view of the magnitude and gravity of the new dan- gers threatening them, it is incumbent on the internatio-nal community as a whole to participate in the protectionof the cultural and natural heritage of outstanding univer-sal value, by the granting of collective assistance which,although not taking the place of action by the Stateconcerned, will serve as an effective complement thereto. Each State Party to this Convention recognises that the duty of ensuring the identification, protection, conserva-tion, presentation and transmission to future generationsof the cultural and natural heritage ... situated on its terri-tory, belongs primarily to that State. ... the States Parties to this Convention recognise that such heritage constitutes a world heritage for whose pro-tection it is the duty of the international community as awhole to cooperate. An Intergovernmental Committee for the Protection of the Cultural and Natural Heritage of OutstandingUniversal Value, called the World Heritage Committee,is hereby established within UNESCO. The Committee shall establish, keep up to date and publi- sh, whenever circumstances shall so require, under thetitle of List of World Heritage in Danger, a list of theproperty appearing in the World Heritage List for theconservation of which major operations are necessary andfor which assistance has been requested under thisConvention. Any State Party to this Convention may request interna- tional assistance for property forming part of the culturalor natural heritage of outstanding universal value situatedwithin its territory. The Convention protects hundreds of sites of outstan- ding universal value -- including cultural, natural andmixed sites. To be included on the World Heritage List, aproperty must meet one or more of the specific cultural ornatural criteria, and its values must withstand the test ofauthenticity andor integrity. The Convention sets four cri-teria for natural sites and six for cultural sites as a meansof determining values by which a property may be desi-gnated a World Heritage site. 1.1.3 An application for a site to be inscribed on the World Heritage List must come from the State Party. The application includes a plan detailing how the site ismanaged and protected, a description of the sites WorldHeritage values and justification for inscribing it on theWorld Heritage List. The World Heritage Committee decides to inscribe a site on the List after examining theevaluations conducted by ICOMOS andor IUCN.WH  manual1-ch1 311002 1435 Page 2 The World Heritage Convention 151.1.4 World Heritage sites are placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger when the World Heritage Committee decides that a site is threatened byexisting or potential threats, such as degradationfrom uncontrolled urbanisation or unsustainableexploitation of natural resources. The Committee can be alerted to possible dangers to a World Heritage site,and then decide in consultation with the State Partywhether to place it on the List of World Heritage inDanger. The List of World Heritage in Danger can serve as a con- servation tool, giving countries access to internationaltechnical assistance. It is also a way to rally political andpublic support for conservation of an endangered site atthe national level. 1.2 Responsibilities 1.2.1 Responsibilities of the State Party. Once a site is inscribed on the World Heritage List, the State Partys pri-mary responsibility is to maintain the values for which thesite was inscribed. Article 5 of the Convention calls foreach State Party to ensure the protection, conservationand presentation of the cultural and natural heritage situ-ated on its territory by taking appropriate legal actions.The Convention urges governments to adopt a generalpolicy which aims to give the cultural and natural heritagea function in the life of the community and to integratethe protection of that heritage into comprehensive plan-ning programmes. Recommendations include taking into account local and national plans, forecasts of populationgrowth or decline, economic factors and traffic projections,as well as taking preventive measures against disasters. 1.2.2 Responsibilities of the World Heritage Centre. The World Heritage Centre, established in 1992, is theworking secretariat of the statutory bodies of theConvention. It helps States Parties to implement theConvention and develop and strengthen local and nation-al capacities for long-term protection and management ofthe sites. The Centre coordinates the exchange of inter-national expertise and assistance, collects and diffusesinformation on the status of World Heritage sites andmaintains databases including the nomination dossiers ofall World Heritage sites. The Centre works in close coop-eration with the States Parties, advisory bodies andUNESCOs Cultural, Science, Educational, Social andHuman Science and Communication sectors. In addition,the Centre develops information material for the media,decision-makers, local authorities, the private sector, localcommunities and site managers. The information is avail-able in printed form and on the Internet.1.3 World Heritage Centre guidance 1.3.1 Tourism-related activities carried out by theWorld Heritage Centre. The World Heritage Centre is engaged in a number of tourism-related activities includ-ing carrying out missions to examine tourism develop-ment projects affecting a sites inscribed values. Suchmissions have included evaluations of the impact of heli-copter flights at the Iguaçu Falls in Brazil of tourism onwildlife in the Galapagos Islands cable car projects atMachu Picchu, Peru, and at Morne Trois Piton NationalPark in Dominica and the reduction and management oftourist flows at the Alhambra, Generalife and Albayzínsites in Granada, Spain. Whos Who of the World Heritage Convention Under the Convention, a 21-member World Heritage Committee is elected by the biennially held GeneralAssembly of all States Parties for six-year terms of office.The Committee receives technical advice from variousconsultative groups in selecting the sites to be listed andto plan its activities. The Convention specifies, in particular, the role of three advisory bodies to support the Committee on technicalissues. The International Council on Monuments and SitesICOMOS, a non-governmental organisation founded in1965 with an international secretariat in Paris, assists theWorld Heritage Committee in the selection of cultural sites to be placed on the World Heritage List. TheInternational Centre for the Study of the Preservation andRestoration of Cultural Property ICCROM, an intergov-ernmental body created by UNESCO in 1956 and based inRome, provides expert advice on conservation of culturalproperties and training activities. The World ConservationUnion IUCN, another intergovernmental agency set upby UNESCO in 1948 and headquartered in Gland,Switzerland, advises the Committee on the selection andconservation of the natural heritage sites. UNESCOs role as the Secretariat to the World Heritage Committee is specifically mentioned in the Convention. Tocoordinate the activities related to World Heritage, whichhave been undertaken by the different services ofUNESCO since the inception of the Convention, theDirector-General of UNESCO established the WorldHeritage Centre in 1992 as the focal point within theOrganisation. The Centre administers the World HeritageFund, updates the World Heritage List and database, andorganises meetings of the Conventions statutory bodiessuch as the World Heritage Committee. It also organisestechnical assistance on request from States Parties,mobilises international cooperation, especially for emer-gency actions when World Heritage sites are threatened,and coordinates the reporting on sites conditions.Organisation of technical seminars and workshops, devel-opment of teaching material to raise public awareness of WH  manual1-ch1 311002 1435 Page 3 The World Heritage Convention 16World Heritage concepts and keeping the media informed on related issues are also among the tasks carried out byUNESCOs World Heritage Centre. The Centre works inclose collaboration with other entities within theOrganisation and other specialised institutions. The World Heritage Convention exerts a continuing influ- ence on tourism policies. In the Galapagos Islands, expertssupported by the World Heritage Fund contributed topolicies for optimal tourist flows to the islands and meas-ures for reducing visitors impact on the site. Elsewhere,for example at the El Vizcaino World Heritage site inMexico, sustainable tourism has been suggested as analternative to economic activities that threaten a site. Centre staff also provide support for regional workshops on World Heritage and the management of protectedareas. Tourism is a major point of discussion at most work-shops. Some are specifically focused on tourism issues,such as a workshop on sustainable tourism in Hue,Vietnam, in 1993 and one on tourism and local commu- nities in Bhaktapur, Nepal, in 2000. In 1993, the Centre,along with UNEP , carried out a study entitled ManagingTourism in World Heritage Natural Sites. Survey informa- tion from this study showed that site managers regardtourism as a key management issue. Such findings gavedirection for efforts such as this manual, which was com-piled in collaboration with UNEP and the Swedish tourismfirm TEMA. Criteria for the Inclusion of Cultural Properties on the World Heritage List The criteria for the inclusion of cultural properties on the World Heritage List are considered in the context of Article 1 of the Convention, that is reproduced below monuments architectural works, works of monumental sculpture and painting, elements or structures of anarchaeological nature, inscriptions, cave dwellings andcombinations of features, which are of outstanding univer-sal value from the point of view of history, art or science groups of buildings groups of separate or connected buildings which, because of their architecture, theirhomogeneity or their place in the landscape, are of out-standing universal value from the point of view of history,art or science sites works of man or the combined works of nature and of man, and areas including archaeological siteswhich are of outstanding universal value from the histori-cal, aesthetic, ethnological or anthropological points ofview. A monument, group of buildings or site -- as defined above -- which is nominated for inclusion on the World Heritage List will be considered to be of outstanding universal value for the purpose of the Convention whenthe Committee finds that it meets one or more of the fol-lowing criteria and the test of authenticity. Each propertynominated should therefore i represent a masterpiece of human creative genius or ii exhibit an important interchange of human values,over a span of time or within a cultural area of the world,on developments in architecture, monumental arts ortown-planning and landscape design oriii bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to acultural tradition or to a civilisation which is living orwhich has disappeared oriv be an outstanding example of a type of building orarchitectural ensemble or landscape which illustrates asignificant stages in human history orv be an outstanding example of a traditional human set-tlement or land-use which is representative of a cultureor cultures, especially when it has become vulnerableunder the impact of irreversible change orvi be directly or tangibly associated with events or livingtraditions, with ideas, or with beliefs, with artistic and lit-erary works of outstanding universal significance theCommittee considers that this criterion should justifyinclusion in the List only in exceptional circumstances orin conjunction with other criteria cultural or natural. Criteria for the Inclusion of Natural Properties on the World Heritage List In accordance with Article 2 of the Convention, the fol- lowing is considered as natural heritage natural features consisting of physical and biological for- mations or groups of such formations, which are of out-standing universal value from the aesthetic or scientificpoint of view geological and physiographical formationsand precisely delineated areas which constitute the habi-tat of threatened species of animals and plants of out-standing universal value from the point of view of scienceor conservation natural sites or precisely delineated natu-ral areas of outstanding universal value from the point ofview of science, conservation or natural beauty. A natural heritage property -- as defined above -- which is submitted for inclusion on the World Heritage List, will beconsidered to be of outstanding universal value for thepurposes of the Convention when the Committee findsthat it meets one or more of the following criteria, andfulfils the conditions of integrity set out below. Sites nom-inated should thereforei be outstanding examples representing major stages ofearths history, including the record of life, significantongoing geological processes in the development of land-forms, or significant geomorphic or physiographic features orWH  manual1-ch1 311002 1435 Page 4 The World Heritage Convention 17ii be outstanding examples representing significant ongoing ecological and biological processes in the evolution and development of terrestrial, fresh water,coastal and marine ecosystems and communities of plantsand animals oriii contain superlative natural phenomena or areas ofexceptional natural beauty and aesthetic importance oriv contain the most important and significant naturalhabitats for in-situ conservation of biological diversity,including those containing threatened species of out-standing universal value from the point of view of science or conservation. To boost management effectiveness, the Centre is setting up an information web site that will enable managers toshare case studies and best practices, from which theymay select and adapt approaches as appropriate for theirsites. Along with other UNESCO units, the Centre sup-ports the ICOMOS Charter for Sustainable CulturalTourism. These guidelines include a complete outline of cultural tourism policies that can aid policy developmentat the country and site level. Many of the recommenda-tions can be adapted for natural areas. 1.3.2 Operational Guidelines. The Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Conventionset out the steps that States Parties must take to fulfil the protection obligations. The guidelines contain information onthe requirements for monitoring, use of the World Heritagelogo and opportunities for technical, training, preparatoryand emergency assistance. At the site level, the OperationalGuidelines can provide information on the assistance avail-able to managers through the World Heritage network. 1.3.3 Promotional and educational materials available through the Centre include a set of 30 exhibition panels explaining the World HeritageConservation process, from identifying a potentialsite through to its inscription and management. These can be used free of copyright restrictions for non-commercial purposes. They may be downloaded as PDFfiles, or obtained directly from the Centre. The themesand texts of some of the panels are as follows  Tourism and site management  Sustainable tourism balancing the best of bothworlds. World Heritage sites attract tourists, and tourism is the worlds biggest and fastest growing industry. What willbe the cost of this tremendous boom to the integrity ofthe sites?  Culturenature the link to preservation The World Heritage emblem symbolises the interde-pendence of the worlds natural and cultural diversity.The World Heritage Committee adopted a global strat-egy for a more representative World Heritage list for the21st century in 1994. It is both a conceptual frameworkand a pragmatic and operational methodology. Cultural landscapes people and nature interacting As part of the effort to make the World Heritage Listmore universal and representative, the concept of cultural landscapes was elaborated in 1992 to recognisesignificant interactions between people and the naturalenvironment.  The Cities Project vision for the 21st century As a centre of civility and urbanity, as a place ofexchanges and encounters, throughout time, cities haveplayed a vital role in the development of civilisation.  World Heritage in young hands Only by instilling a deep sense of responsibility in youngpeople towards the World Heritage can we be confi-dent that the planets cultural and natural diversity willendure into the future. Also of interest is an educational resource kit for teachers entitled, World Heritage in Young Hands. The kit ispublished in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, and Spanishwith more than 20 other language versions under prepa-ration. The kit is available on the UNESCO WHC web siteand for sale at UN and UNESCO bookstores in English,Spanish, and French. A number of films on World Heritage sites have been produced. Information is available through the WorldHeritage Centre. 1.3.4 Use of the World Heritage emblem. The emblem has fund-raising potential that can be usedto increase the marketing value of products withwhich it is associated. It symbolises the Convention, sig- nifies the States Parties adherence to the Convention,and serves to identify sites inscribed on the WorldHeritage List. The emblem should be used to further theaims of the Convention and enhance knowledge of the Convention world-wide. It should not be used forunauthorised commercial purposes. The OperationalGuidelines include directions on the use of the emblem byWorld Heritage sites and other contracting parties, especially those operating for predominantly commercialpurposes. 1.4 Monitoring activities involving site managers 1.4.1 Reactive monitoring. Several types of moni- toring at W orld Heritage sites can involve site managers. When a site faces a threat, the World Heritage Committee or the State Party may request reac-tive monitoring. On the basis of reactive monitoringreports, the World Heritage Committee makes recom- mendations for addressing the problems. These recom-mendations are used where necessary to direct appealsfor international assistance. This can include funding forstudies on alternative economic activities that would beless damaging to the site, such as a sustainable tourismprogramme. Reactive monitoring missions are organisedby the World Heritage Centre and are carried out by international experts.WH  manual1-ch1 311002 1435 Page 5 The World Heritage Convention 18The Purposes of Periodic Reporting To ensure the efficient implementation of the World Heritage Convention, it is essential that all the actorsinvolved have access to up-to-date information on theapplication of the Convention and on the state of conser-vation of World Heritage properties. To establish this information, the World Heritage Committee made a number of decisions regarding period-ic reports at its 22nd session held in 1998. In accordancewith Article 29 of the World Heritage Convention, theState Parties to the Convention will provide periodicreports, which will give information on the legislativeand administrative provisions which they have adoptedand other action which they have taken for the applica-tion of this Convention, together with details of the expe-rience acquired in this field. Periodic reporting is intended to provide  an assessment of the application of the World Heritage Convention by the State Party  an assessment as to whether the World Heritage values of the properties inscribed on the World Heritage Listare being maintained over time  updated information about the changing circumstances and state of conservation of the properties and  a mechanism for regional cooperation and exchange of information and experiences between States Partiesconcerning the implementation of the Convention andWorld Heritage conservation. 1.4.2 Periodic reporting. Periodic reports are submit- ted by the States Parties every six years on the stateof conservation of World Heritage sites. The World Heritage Centre can assist States Parties in preparing thereports. State Parties are also asked to submit reports and impact studies when large-scale work is undertaken at thesites, which may have an effect on the state of conserva-tion. Proactive strategies are being developed for each ofthe regions for monitoring heritage. The World Heritage Committee has opted for a regional approach to periodic reporting as a means of promotingregional collaboration and strategies. Each regional strat- egy is to result in a Regional State of the World HeritageReport. The periodic report consists of two sections. Section I covers the State Partys overall application of the WorldHeritage Convention, including its efforts to identify prop-erties of cultural andor natural value the protection, con-servation and presentation of the cultural and naturalheritage international cooperation and fund-raising andeducation, information and awareness building. Section II reports on the state of conservation of the sites. The main objective is to demonstrate whether the World Heritage values for which a property was inscribed on the World Heritage List have been maintained over time. All States Parties are requested to provide updated informa-tion on site management, factors affecting the propertyand monitoring arrangements. 1.5 Implications and recommendations  A tourism strategy must respect the values for which thesite was inscribed. The documentation that was preparedfor the sites nomination can provide direction for settingpolicy. This subject is discussed in more detail in Chapter4. Dossiers compiled for site nomination can be obtainedthrough the Centre or through the State Party.  Classification as a World Heritage site helps to attract donor organisations. Proposals should always highlightthe sites original values as a point of reference.  Monitoring carried out at World Heritage sites should involve site managers. Quantitative monitoring can beespecially worthwhile. Governments are aware of boththe economic benefits that tourism can generate and theeconomic potential of World Heritage sites. Thus, con-crete data demonstrating the benefits of tourism derivingfrom the sites World Heritage designation can fostercooperation in monitoring efforts between the Centre,the government and the site. Suggested Activities 1.Review the sites inscription dossier to help formulate future policy and management objectives.  If the inscription dossier is not already a part of the sites reference library, request a copy from the relevantgovernment authority or the World Heritage Centre. Analyse how the sites listing criteria should be reflected in its overall tourism policy and management objectives. Develop these ideas along with members of staff and produce an outline that can be used for later policydevelopment. 2.List ways in which the sites World Heritage values could be reflected and incorporated into interpretationprogrammes.  Review the criteria for which the site was selected for inscription on the World Heritage List, as well as thesites established policy and management objectives. Select the species, monuments, art, etc., which arestrongly identified with the sites World Heritage values. With staff, describe how these attractions can be bestrepresented in interpretation materials. 3.List ways to monitor tourist attractions representing World Heritage values.WH  manual1-ch1 311002 1435 Page 6 The World Heritage Convention 19 Review the section of the World Heritage Convention application form entitled Format for PeriodicReporting. Review the original nomination dossier and contactthe government authorities in charge of periodic moni-toring so as to increase coordination. Determine which elements of the site best representWorld Heritage values and attract tourists, and state changes that may be appropriate in the request forperiodic monitoring reporting data.

Knowledge of the structure of the industryhelps managers to identify opportunities for obtain-ing assistance in management and protection effortsthrough tourism. Knowledge of market segmentsand categories can help when writing project propos-als and reports. Information on market segments canalso provide useful input during the development of promotion and interpretation programmes. 2.1 The structure of the tourism industry 2.2.1 The tourism industry is multi-tiered, from thoseresponsible for promotion to those who serve the consumer directly. The industry comprises the following organisational structuresThe main responsibility for promotion of a countrystourism attractions lies with government-funded touristorganisations such as National Tourism Offices NTOs. NTOs collaborate with hotels and air carriers to raisefinance for destination promotion programmes. Theydevote much of their overseas efforts to establishing rela-tionships with tour operators and travel agencies. NTOssupport new developments or new tours by providingintroductions and influencing development plans affect-ing destinations, as well as legislative or financial policies.They provide support for familiarisation trips, hold promo-tional events and produce research data. Tour operators outbound providers, tour agencies , and ground operators in-country or inbound providers are on the front line of the industry. Tour operators arecompanies that sell tours to customers, either directly orindirectly through travel agents. Tour operators vary insize. Many of the smaller firms handle specialised marketssuch as eco-tourism and adventure travel. They providetravel agents with marketing support, for example byoffering familiarisation visits for staff members. Tour oper-ators often go to the same locations, and promotionalmaterials and brochures tend to look alike. Tour compa-nies try to differentiate their destinations with gradationsof challenge or price, for example at ski resorts, whereaccommodations may be more or less luxurious and theskiing may be more or less difficult. Although TourOperators respond for only about 12  of global tourismflows IFTO, 2002, they can help bridge low travel sea-sons by providing a steadier market, develop new desti-nations and can help define service and infrastructureneeds at local level. In contrast, travel agencies handle a wide variety of trav- el packages available from tour operators and airlines. InEurope and in North America, a high percentage of toursare marketed to the public through travel agencies. InEurope, travel agencies dominate the supply of holidaysand largely determine the information on which mostclients base their holiday decisions. Large tour operators select travel agents to represent them on the basis of the agencys productivity. Local individuals, national groups,international enterprises or any combination of the threemay own travel agencies. Although website sales to indi-vidual consumers are on the rise, generally, travel agenciessell tours from brochures and the computerised reserva-tion systems of major tour operators. Therefore,brochures are pivotal to the business. However, so manybrochures are available for example, about 4,000 inBritain in 1993, that travel agencies simply cannot stockthe full range. What winds up on their display cases is afunction of the commissions paid by tour operators, theefficiency of their reservation systems, and the strength ofthe business relationship. In general, travel agencies arenot prepared to offer information from outside the corepackage tours that they sell. Related to tour operators are ground operators, or in-coun- try operators who handle logistics or ground operations.They handle tourist groups from the moment of arrival offthe plane or boat, until departure. They can also sell toursin the countries in which they are operating. Ground oper-ators are mostly based in capital cities and are usually well-educated host nationals who can speak several languages.In some countries a key to increasing a sites popularity is tohave reliable ground operators working with tour operatorsin Europe or North America. A scarcity of ground operators,while unlikely to deter independent travellers, may discour-age consumers of organised tours who depend on theirservices. 2.2 International tourism markets The tourism market comprises three general classifications  the independent travel market,  the speciality activity market, and  the general package-holiday market. Independent travellers are not part of organised groups but travel alone or in small groups of friends. They traveleither out of a general interest or because they want topractise a certain activity in a new and different environ-ment. Most independent travellers are young, adventur-ous, willing to use rustic accommodations, eat traditionalfoods, and take public transport. Independent travellersget much of their information on a tourist destinationeither from friends who have visited the area or throughguidebooks, newspaper and magazine articles, or,increasingly, from the Internet. Many in the tourism indus-try discount these tourists because they tend to travelcheaply, falling into the category of the budget-consciousbackpacking crowd. In reality, independent travellersare explorers who are often responsible for popularis-ing a destination. Their financial input is often enough toenable local businesses to expand and improve rusticaccommodations for more demanding tourist groups.Such travellers, often young, are more willing to use localgoods and services, and interact more with the communi-ty outside the supervision of an organised tour, whichunfortunately may cause negative social impacts.2WH  manual1-ch2 311002 1438 Page 2 The Tourism Industry Implications for Managers 23Speciality tourism firms organise trips for clients wishing to participate in a specific activity such as bird-watching,wildlife viewing, photography or archaeological,historical and cultural tours. Also in this category are adventure travel firms offering activities such as back-packingtrekking, white water rafting, kayaking, canoe-ing, rock climbing and sport fishing. Other speciality firmsorganise field research trips for scientists. These firmsattract groups of paying volunteers who sign up to workas field assistants on projects such as archaeological digsand wildlife monitoring programmes. In addition, thismarket includes organisations and universities with specialinterest travel programmes. For example, the World-wideFund for Nature and many museums organise tours fortheir members. These tours generally help to raise fundsfor a particular cause or project. These groups generallysub-contract to other tour operators to handle the travelarrangements. Speciality tour operators commonly usehost-country ground operators for in-country logistics.These national firms, based in the country in which thetour is operating, provide all services transportation, hotelaccommodations, guides, etc. from arrival to departure.Some speciality firms in North America and Europe handleground operations in a foreign country for themselves,but they tend to be exceptions to the rule. Managersshould be aware that many speciality companies are smalland go in and out of business rapidly. The general package-holiday market attracts groups wishing to see an area and its culture but without a spe-cific interest in a defined activity or subject matter. Thesetourists tend to be interested in general sightseeing andshopping, and may be interested in cultural attractionssuch as museums, ruins or other well-known or docu-mented historical sites. Tourists in this market tend towant the standard services and amenities offered by mostgeneral tours. They will probably not be satisfied with theservices that a rural community can offer more often thannot, general international tour groups want comfort, easeof access, security and more upscale accommodationsand food. 2.3 Understanding speciality markets 2.3.1 While the bulk of the tourism business contin-ues to be mass-market package holidays, specialisedholidays are growing in popularity. Tourism is more than ever before divided into market segments definingdifferent types of experiences. Specialised holidays caterto peoples particular interests, such as sailing, bird-watch-ing, photography or archaeology. Markets or market seg-ments have been developed around the differentactivities. Specialised holidays have become so popular that whole new categories of travel have emerged, including eco-tourism, adventure travel, heritage tourism and culturaltourism. A trek in the Himalayas is now likely to be con-sidered adventure travel, and a week visiting cultural sitesin India as cultural tourism.2.3.2 Eco-tourism is one of the most frequently cited categories of the new tourism. It is defined by the International Ecotourism Society as, responsible travel tonatural areas that conserves the environment and sustainsthe well being of local people. A number of activitieshave been labelled eco-tourism, including bird- andwhale-watching, helping scientists conduct conservationresearch, snorkelling off coral reefs, game viewing and nature photography. Eco-tourism is linked to and overlapswith heritage tourism and cultural tourism. Surveys show that eco-tourists tend to be young and highly educated, with professional and managerial occu-pations. Eco-tourism trips tend to be longer, with fewerpeople in the typical tour group. Researchers report thateco-tourists are more likely to use small independenthotels, as opposed to mass tourists, who tend to stay atchain hotels. As would be expected, the eco-tourist isinterested in a more natural environment, preferring lesscrowded destinations that are off the beaten track andthat offer challenging experiences. At the site level, the demands of eco-tourists and main- stream tourists may overlap and be difficult to differenti-ate. Some eco-tourists, for example, may demandcondominiums, not campgrounds, for lodging. People ona bird-watching cruise to Patagonia could be consideredeco-tourists but may have demands similar to those oftourists on an expensive Caribbean islands cruise. In prac-tice, eco-tourism connotes a travel ethic, promoting con-servation behaviours and certain economic policies.Examples are, an emphasis on low-impact techniques forviewing wildlife and a preference for hiring local guides. 2.3.3 Adventure tourism includes a wide range of outdoor activities. Adventure tourists engage in activi- ties that are physically challenging and sometimes dan-gerous, or perceived to be so. Examples are sports such astrekking, mountaineering, white-water rafting and scubadiving. Adventure tourism does not necessarily requireexpensive facilities and infrastructure, but it does requiregood organisation, guides, transportation services, basicaccommodation in the field, and opportunities for morecomfortable accommodation at the end of the tour.Adventure travel is a rapidly growing sector of the spe-ciality tourism market. 2.3.4 Cultural tourism is frequently used to describe certain segments of the travel market. It may be asso- ciated with visits to historical, artistic and scientific or her-itage attractions. The World Tourism Organisation WTOhas two definitions of cultural tourism. In the narrowsense, cultural tourism includes movements of personsfor essentially cultural motivations such as study tours,performing arts and cultural tours, travel to festivals andother cultural events, visits to sites and monuments, trav-el to study nature, folklore or art, and pilgrimages. In thebroader sense it is defined as all movements of persons,because they satisfy the human need for diversity, tendingto raise the cultural level of the individual and giving rise2WH  manual1-ch2 311002 1438 Page 3 The Tourism Industry Implications for Managers 24to new knowledge, experience and encounters. Because culture is subjective, definitions of cultural tourism tend tobe either too wide or too narrow, limiting their practicaluse in the field. 2.3.5 Heritage tourism is a broad category that embraces both eco-tourism and cultural tourism,with an emphasis on conserving natural and cultur-al heritage. It is a category or market segment that includes visits to historic sites, museums and art galleries,and exploring national and forest parks. Heritage tourism,because of the large number of activities it covers, is diffi-cult to define and measure. In recent years city plannersinterested in urban regeneration have adopted the termto describe many tourism programmes, a strategy that hasreceived support from business and banks. Many other tourism terms reflect environmental ethics and local interests. Environmental preservation concernshave given rise to what is known as green tourism, con-servation-supporting tourism, and environmentally awareor environmentally sound tourism. Generally, such tourismfavours minimal environmental impact and emphasisesconcern over environmental issues. Urban and ruraltourism categories have also been created. However, sincefew countries have made the distinction, quantificationhas been difficult. 2.4 Sustainable tourism 2.4.1 The idea of sustainability is found in all themarket segments and definitions of the newtourism. All the definitions address preservation of the resource for future generations the use of tourism to con- tribute to environmental protection limiting negativesocio-economic impacts, and benefiting local people eco-nomically and socially. The WTO defines sustainabletourism as Tourism development that meets the needsof the present tourists and host regions while protectingand enhancing opportunity for the future. The desiredoutcome is that resources will be managed in such a waythat economic, social and aesthetic needs can be fulfilledwhile maintaining cultural integrity, essential ecologicalprocesses, biological diversity and life support systems.The term sustainable tourism is frequently used in proj-ect proposals seeking international assistance. In practice, sustainable tourism programmes are an opportunity that also demands hard work. They requireclearly defined goals and objectives that highlight theessential features of sustainability within the local context,an ongoing process of addressing stakeholder needs within the framework of these goals and objectives, andconstant monitoring. As with all sustainable developmentprojects, this process is labour intensive, takes time andusually involves many interest groups, making pro-grammes difficult to design, implement and maintain. Sustainable tourism programmes have highlighted the need for an environmental and social focus and led to thestandardisation of some environmental practices as wellas new ideas about how the industry should function.Discussion has produced policy goals and guidelines forplanners and an impetus for self-regulation by the industry. 2.5 Tourist types 2.5.1 Seeking definitions that would be more usefulin practice, researchers have concentrated ontourists behaviours and preferences. Definitions and their related market segments, such as adventure travel orcultural tourism, tend to group people into broad cate-gories based on a range of activities. These definitions andactivities necessarily overlap, making it difficult at the sitelevel to differentiate between types of tourism. For exam-ple, eco-tourism and heritage tourism combine aspects ofboth culture and nature, as do most speciality tours. Sofor instance, trekking in the Himalayas is considered anadventure travel activity, but most trekkers visit Buddhistor Hindu cultural sites at the same time. Bird-watchersvisit archaeology sites and frequently engage in trekking.The broad definitions of the international markets are too comprehensive to be used for site-specific decision-making. An effective way of addressing this overlap for research, policy and site management purposes is to classify touristsaccording to their motivations, behaviours and desiredexperiences. Researchers have developed several cate-gories of tourist behaviours and preferences. For example,tourists may be classified according to the intensity ofexperiences they are seeking or the ruggedness of theconditions they desire or will accept, including the kind ofaccommodations expected. Thus Hard-core tourists join tours or groups travelling specifi- cally for educational purposes andor to take part in envi-ronmental or cultural projects, such as wildlife monitoring. Dedicated tourists want to visit protected or cultural areas and understand local natural and cultural history. Casual tourists consider natural and cultural travel as an incidental component of a broader trip. Another system that is useful for classifying preferences differentiates between hard-class and soft-classtravel. This classification relates to the ruggedness factor,mostly concerning the degree of challenge involved andthe comfort level of accommodations. These categoriesinclude A hard-class experience that is physically difficult with an element of danger. For example, it may require walkingmiles into the back country, climbing a technically difficultmountain, or sleeping in rudimentary shelters.2WH  manual1-ch2 311002 1438 Page 4 The Tourism Industry Implications for Managers 25A soft-class experience means lower risk and more luxu- rious accommodations. For example, a tented safari mayinvolve physically challenging conditions while offeringamenities such as gourmet meals and comfortable transport. 2.6 Tourism trends 2.6.1 Tourists are becoming more interested in envi-ronmental protection. Consumers are increasingly con- sidering environmental quality as well as the quality ofservices as factors in their selection of tourist destinations.More and more consumers want a high standard of envi-ronmental conservation coupled with simple, efficient and pleasant service. It appears that many tourists now preferunspoiled and uncrowded destinations. A related trend is that, before they travel, many tourists inform themselves about environmental problems at indi-vidual sites. They want destinations to be clean and envi-ronmentally sound. Tourists will avoid places that are perceived to fall short of this image. More than ever thisinformation is obtained through the internet. Environmental degradation can lead not only to declining tourism rates but also to changes in the types of touriststhat travel to a site. Examples of this cycle are found in theMediterranean, where the pattern has led to continueddegradation and urbanisation of beach resorts. 2.6.2 Interest in cultural tourism seems to be expanding, but the rate of growth is unclear. More quantitative data is needed to verify the trend. For exam-ple, attendance at cultural attractions in Britain and theNetherlands over the last five years indicates that culturaltourism has kept pace with the overall tourism market. Because the cultural tourism market is difficult to quanti- fy, experts suggest that more research would help to iden-tify broad groupings of cultural tourists based on theirmotivations. Establishing categories such as arts, archae-ology, language learning and so on may be the most prac-tical way to address this issue. 2.6.3 Tourists increasingly want real experiences with other cultures and lifestyles. A study of mass- market tourists and eco-tourists found that both groupsfelt that knowledge of folk arts and handicrafts, as well asknowledge about the destinations history, was important. 2.6.4 Consumers are seeking more active and educa- tional holidays. Specialised markets are experiencing a trend towards energetic, environment-oriented tourism,with healthy menus and plenty of opportunities for exer-cise. Although mass-market tourists are less active andadventuresome, and less focused on one activity, activeholidays at a lower level of intensity are also a growingtrend in this market segment.2.6.5 Visits to protected areas are on the rise. In developed countries, tourists tend to travel in small-er groups for shorter time periods. For example, visits to Australian national parks have increased substantially inthe last ten years, but often for shorter periods. The twotrends together -- smaller group sizes and shorter stays --have created a need for greater individual space and morefacilities designed to accommodate intense use, withextra services added during certain times of the year. 2.6.6 The tourism industry is expected to take more responsibility for sustainable development.Professionals working in conservation are beginning toask the industry to be more involved in site managementactivities. Often this involves assuming a degree of finan-cial responsibility for the long-term maintenance of theresources they profit from. Financial support can be in the form of direct or voluntary subsidies to managementagencies or NGOs. Involvement may also mean acceptingpractices that limit the negative impacts of tourism. Anexample is at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park inAustralia where operators have become increasingly self-regulating and accountable through the establishment of codes of conduct and guidelines for minimal impact prac-tices. Operators at the Great Barrier Reef are also involvedin the monitoring of their sites. The fact that operators areprohibited from relocating their facilities and activitiesonce an existing site is affected by natural or unnaturalenvironmental degradation has reinforced these actions. 2.7 Implications and recommendations  Tourism definitions can give direction to broad policyguidelines used in the development of goals and objec-tives for site management. For example, the InternationalEco-tourism Societys definition of eco-tourism states thattourism should maintain the integrity of an ecosystem andgenerate economic opportunities that make conservationbeneficial to local people. This type of a statement can beincorporated into a policy statement defining the type oftourism a site will promote.  Tourism definitions, such as that of eco-tourism, can be used in reports or proposals seeking funding for futureprojects. They can give documents a positive image andstrengthen their attractiveness. Overall development con-cepts and definitions should match the audience forwhom the proposal is being written. For example, theterm eco-tourism should be used in place of tourismwhen writing to nature conservation organisations cul-tural tourism when writing to organisations concernedwith the restoration of monuments, and so on. Marketdefinitions can then be used in promotional materials. Forexample, a brochure may mention that eco-tourism isencouraged at a particular natural or mixed site.  Operators promotional materials give clues as to whether their products are compatible with site objec-tives. Tour operator literature can also help managersdetermine whether operators contribute locally to protec-2WH  manual1-ch2 311002 1438 Page 5 The Tourism Industry Implications for Managers 26tion efforts such as educating clients in low-impact prac- tices. Promotional literature will also reveal the types ofclients they are targeting, what kind of experiences theyvalue and their particular needs. For example, an operatormay specialise in tours geared to a serious, single-mindedbird-watching group or an amateur archaeology group.  While knowledge of tourism definitions and speciality tourist markets can help managers set policy guidelinesand understand visitor interests, the categories are gener-al and tend to overlap. For management purposes it isuseful to classify and analyse tourists according to theirpreferences and behaviours. Categories such as hardand soft class provide a helpful start. These categories,which focus on visitor needs and expectations, are impor-tant for elaborating management plans and setting objec-tives including infrastructure development.  Knowledge of the different market segments and the general behaviours and preferences of tourists can helpmanagers decide which segments to promote. Differenttourists present different management opportunities andrequirements. For example, tourists seeking more demanding or harder experiences are more likely to becontent with a minimal infrastructure than those seekinga softer experience. Tour operators such as those work-ing with keen bird-watchers or clients interested inarchaeology may have special market demands. Thesespecialised operators may want strict regulation of touristnumbers and noise to permit them to practise their activ-ities undisturbed by other groups. In view of the range ofpreferences among nature-oriented people, the marketshould offer a range of accommodation.  An analysis of the structure of the tourism industry sur- rounding a site can reveal opportunities for involving stakeholders in management. NTO officials could beinvolved in future promotional efforts. Tour operators andhoteliers who may also help with monitoring activities orestablishing codes of conduct and minimal impact prac-tices. They may also make direct financial contributionsfor on-site projects. Interviews with tour operators andhotel directors could determine what mechanisms, admin-istrative and financial, would facilitate their contributionsto conservation and protection efforts.  A proactive approach will yield benefits if market trends are addressed. Continued growth in international tourismis predicted, particularly in special interest tourism. Thegrowing concern over environmental and socio-culturalissues suggests the existence of a large potential source ofsupport for the site. Socio-economic profiles suggest thatmore and more tourists will have the means to contributefinancially towards protection of the site. Consequently, ifa site is planned and managed well, within defined limits,an increase in arrivals can potentially bring new financialrewards.  Because tourists are more conscious of, and interested in, the protection of the natural, historical, cultural andsocial environment, it will be increasingly important toinform tourists and tour operators, through site interpre-tation and promotional activities, of the efforts that man-agement is making to maintain the site.  A preference for protected areas is a growing trend in tourism. Managers must be increasingly cognizant ofthese visitors profiles and of visitation trends specific toeach site. Suggested Activities 1.Analyse the tourism structure of the site.  Interview National Tourism Office officials to gain insights into the tourism structure of the country as awhole. Interview members of the tourism industry, at the siteand if possible in major cities, to determine how tourismagencies and tour and ground operators draw touriststo the site. Outline the various groups of visitors and describehow they interact. Begin identifying the types oftourism at the site and develop preliminary categoriesof tourists. Review past efforts to involve the tourism industry insupporting the site list any options for involving them. 2.Determine in detail the type of tourist at the site and those desired.  Examine tourists travel patterns, their activities and the attractions they visit. Create profiles of the user groups. Use the lists in thischapter to help determine, for example, whether theyare tourists who come under the hard or soft cat-egories. Decide which tourist markets are preferred. Review the differences among user groups. Examine the tourism brochures of the various touroperators serving the site and determine which marketsthey serve. Develop a list of the preferred groups, markets andrelated activities that would foster tourism development and choose the tour companies that would best servethese needs.2WH  manual1-ch2 311002 1438 Page 6 The Tourism Industry Implications for Managers 27Suggested Reading Ceballos-Lascurain, H.

Knowledge of the causesof tourism impacts and problems aids decision-mak-ing and fosters more effective management actions.A basic knowledge of the range of impacts can alsoaid planning and generate a useful checklist fordeveloping tourism monitoring indicators, essentialfor determining whether management objectives arebeing met. 3.1 General tourism impacts issues and concepts Tourism impacts are caused mainly by development and by visitors themselves. Development impacts, usually relat-ed to infrastructure, can be widely felt and can be severe,for example, during the construction phase, and throughpollution generated by hotels. Impacts caused by touristswithin sites are often quite sensitive but can usually beavoided. For example, visitors can be asked not to feedwildlife or touch rock art. The cause-and-effect relationships of tourism impacts can be difficult to identify. Litter may be dropped by local peo-ple and not by tourists water pollution may come fromupstream sources other than hotels a coral reef may bedamaged by storm and wave action, and not tourismpoaching by local residents may be to blame for decliningwildlife populations. Visitor volume is not necessarily the primary factor influ- encing the amount of impact. Solutions designed to limitnumbers in a given area may not be effective. Nowresearchers know that impacts are linked to a complex set of socio-environmental factors and development patterns.According to current thinking, it is important to under-stand the inter-relationships that cause tourism impactswhich might, for example, lead one community to wel-come tourists while another community develops strongopposition to a tourist presence. The relationship between amount of use and environ- mental impacts is often not linear but curvilinear. That is,initial light use may cause the most damage, while subse-quent use has progressively less impact. For resourcessuch as soils and vegetation, most damage tends to occurat low use levels. An example is the relationship betweenthe amount of trampling and soil compaction. The firstwalkers to use a piece of terrain will compact most of thesoil, and additional use will have proportionally lessimpact on the area. A similar relationship exists with veg-etation impacts initial light trampling can lead to high lev-els of damage, with relatively minor change thereafter. Two main impact factors are resistance and resilience. Resistance is the ability to absorb use without being dis-turbed, and resilience is the ability to return to an undis-turbed state after a disturbance. In practical terms, resistance is a measure of the ability of different environ- ments and different cultures to resist change. Sherpas inNepal have been able to absorb the presence of touristswhile maintaining their culture for several generations,whereas the hill tribes in northern Thailand have seen pro-gressively greater cultural change affecting their core fam-ily structure. At natural sites, fertile soils are better able towithstand use and maintain vegetation thin soils have lit-tle chance to withstand heavy use. Lichens are consis-tently found to have low resistance to trampling. Coralcommunities in windward reef crest zones, which with-stand the pounding of ocean surf, are more resistant todamage caused by divers than coral communities in moreprotected flat zones. Resilience can also vary. The recovery rates of damaged vegetation depend on the fragility of a given ecosystem.Species of coral vary in the time it takes for them to recov-er after being damaged. Communities and the peoplewithin them adjust their life styles at different paces toaccommodate visitors. They may also readjust their use ofnatural resources if these resources become restrictedwhen an area goes under protection. 3.2 Environmental impacts common pat- terns and factors 3.2.1 Vegetation impacts vary with type of use and botanical differences in structure. Resistant plants include the grasses and sedges. Plants susceptible to tram-pling impacts include those with slow growth rates,thorns and prickles, flexible stems and leaves, and smallthick leaves that fold under pressure. Plant species foundin open grassy habitats are generally more tolerant oftrampling, while forest floor plants are less resistant. 3.2.2 Impacts on soil usually involve compaction and erosion. Tourism often leads to soil compaction, usu- ally an unavoidable aspect of recreation activities.Compaction packs soil particles together and reducespore space, leading to a reduction in aeration and waterinfiltration. This increases water runoff from rain andmelting snow, causing reduced water absorption, a loss ofvegetation cover and erosion. Soil compaction, whileunavoidable, can be limited to certain areas. Erosion, onthe other hand, is more serious and tends to spread. Soils most prone to compaction are fine-textured homo- geneous soils such as clay and silt. Wet soils are moreprone to compaction and more readily churned. Meadowsoil and vegetation can be rapidly disturbed when tram-pled during rainy periods, increasing erosion and loweringthe water table. 3.2.3 Water impacts are associated with pathogens, organic waste and turbidity. Water turbidity from soil erosion is a frequent result of tourism infrastructure andrecreation. Where soils are more prone to erosion, tourist activities and development are more likely to alter waterquality to the detriment of aquatic flora and fauna.3WH  manual1-ch3 311002 1444 Page 2 Tourism Impacts and Problems 31Among water pollutants, pathogens are the most danger- ous. Common examples are faecal coliforms human andfaecal streptococci animal. High faecal counts are associ-ated with a lack of or malfunctioning of sewage and septic tank systems in hotels, and run-off from touristenclaves. Organic waste such as raw or insufficiently treat-ed sewage also affects water quality by encouraging algaeand weeds. These plants can wash up on shorelines, thendecay and form a breeding ground for insects. In general, chemical contamination is most severe in shal- low water sheltered from wind, especially in areas such asmarinas. Lakes and streams at lower elevations tend to beless vulnerable to alteration than alpine lakes. 3.2.4 Disturbances caused by tourists viewing wildlife affect some species more than others. Some species habituate, that is, after the initial impact, whichmay be serious, they develop a tolerance for disturbance.Habituation is often mistakenly seen as positive because itbrings visitors closer to the wildlife. Tour operators some-times put food out to attract animals to places where vis-itors can see them. Attraction can be a negative response,however habituated wildlife may become aggressivewhile begging for food, and can injure and even kill theunwary visitor. Wildlife responses are variable, even within a single species or population. For example, some animals can tol-erate occasional disturbances but not frequent distur-bances. Nesting birds may tolerate the first fewencounters with humans, but once their level of toleranceis exceeded they may abandon their nests. Some animalsdevelop a tolerance for predictable disturbances, noisefrom passing cars for example, but cannot tolerate ran-dom disturbances. Larger game species tend to be moreaffected by direct contact with people, while smallerwildlife are more susceptible to indirect impacts on theirhabitat. More timid and sensitive species of animalsbecome permanently displaced from recreation areaswhen confronted by humans, while other animals such asdeer become habituated over time. Some animals frighten more easily than others, a factor that affects feeding and reproductive patterns. Maine tur-tles and some bird species in the Galapagos National Parkwithdraw from habitats visited by tourists and move toother places less suitable for survival and reproduction.Deer, which like other ungulates are relatively unafraid ofhumans, often graze along roadsides. Wolves are moresensitive to tourists, whose encroachment can restricttheir opportunities for hunting. Habitat is an importantfactor. Wildlife disturbance is much less significant ontourist trails in wooded areas where animals have morecover. Animals, like people, have accumulated experiencesthat guide their behaviour, and as a result there is no idealdistance from a sensitive wildlife site such as a rookery ora feeding area for infrastructure or trails. Many experts saysimply that if visitors elicit a negative response fromwildlife they are too close.Case Study Rhinos in Nepal In Nepals Royal Chitwan National Park, tourists on ele- phant-back, viewing rhinoceros, caused stress and beha-vioural changes in the rhinos, resulting in less time spentfeeding and more time on the alert. Where touristsexceeded a certain minimal distance, about half the rhi-nos abandoned the best quality pasture and took shelterin less nourishing dense vegetation. Researchers think thissituation may affect the genetic makeup of the rhino,favouring the reproduction of tame animals over timidones. 3.3 Common impacts related to visitor use 3.3.1 Visitors exhibit predictable patterns. People tend to travel along established routes and be attracted tocertain locations. Consequently, impacts are usually con-fined to these areas. However, tourism areas tend toexpand over time. A related phenomenon is that once anarea is opened to tourism and recreation, impacts willoccur rapidly. Overall, environmental impacts have a ten-dency to be curvilinear see Chapter 6. 3.3.2 Group size plays a role in the development of impacts. Large parties tend to expand the areas they visit. This has management ramifications for groups such asmountaineering expeditions where large parties can cre-ate small cities during the length of their stay. Large par-ties also can create a heavy amount of use in a short time.As a result, large parties are of particular concern in pris-tine natural areas and at delicate cultural sites. At culturalsites large parties can cause bottlenecks at an interpreta-tive display. At monuments they can overwhelm certainexhibitions, blocking the view of smaller groups or indi-viduals. Large groups can block the flow of visitor traffic,for example, through a cathedral. There are exceptions to this pattern. Along a trail or cathe- dral walkway, for example, large parties probably have nomore impact than small parties as long as they remain onthe trail or walkway. With wildlife, large parties may haveless impact than several small parties if the frequency ofdisturbance is a factor, as in the situation with manyspecies of birds. 3.3.3 Various activities are associated with certain types of impacts. For example, rock climbing and nature photography can disturb nesting birds. Scuba diving andcruising can cause damage to coral reefs. Horseback rid-ing, hiking and camping cause vegetation and soil distur-bance. Visitors to monuments can cause abrasion throughtouching. Activities involving motor vehicles have negative impacts on many fragile environments. Noisy motorboats andwater scooters disrupt the feeding and breeding patternsof birds, and can injure other aquatic wildlife. Motorboatpropellers repeatedly kill and maim docile freshwater3WH  manual1-ch3 311002 1444 Page 3 Tourism Impacts and Problems 32manatees. Motorboats are also highly polluting one powerboat emits 70 times more hydrocarbons than anaverage car does. Beach vehicles disrupt the accumulationof seaweed that provides mulch for colonising dune veg-etation. Soil compacted by vehicles in the Mojave Desertin the United States would need about a century to berestored. Because of these impacts, managers often rec- ommend banning motorised vehicles from fragile areassuch as sand dunes and deserts. Impacts vary according to how tourists practise different activities. Well-trained divers with good buoyancy controlare less likely to damage coral than inexperienced divers.Mountaineers trained in low-impact camping cause farless damage than those without such training. Some con-scientious tour operators adopt certain viewing policies tolimit impacts on wildlife. Many operators of whale-watch-ing tours have their drivers maintain set distances fromthe whales, avoid chasing the animals, and switch off theboat engines during close-up viewing so as not to pro-duce undue stress. At a cultural site, for example a sacredrock art site or a church, visitors can be asked to show respect by covering their heads or maintaining silence. Impacts caused by tourists are usually unintentional andcan frequently be reduced through sensitivity training. 3.3.4 Crowding is a negative impact when it inter- feres with tourists expectations. Early research found that increases in visitor numbers led to decreases in satis-faction levels. As a result, managers sought to determinethe point at which visitation numbers would cause a feel-ing of crowding. However, it turns out that the relation-ship between numbers of people and visitor satisfaction ismore complicated. While large numbers of people at asite can certainly decrease aesthetic enjoyment and dimin-ish opportunities for solitude, sheer numbers do not nec-essarily diminish visitor satisfaction. Instead, negativereactions tend to occur when tourists feel that fellow vis- itors are interfering with their desired experience. A fur-ther complication is that the negative effects of crowdingvary with the characteristics of different visitors, theirexperience with the area, fellow visitors behaviour, andthe characteristics and peculiarities of the setting. Forexample, people viewing wildlife in Maasai Mara, a naturereserve, may be annoyed by the presence of only a few other vehicles, while at a game park other vehicles aremore expected. Visitors may also change their expecta-tions associated with an activity in order to toleratecrowded conditions.The Classic Community Tourism Cycle  Stage 1 Communities build small bungalows for local tourism. Residential houses are renovated and convert-ed into small hotels and boarding lodges, earning rev-enue for local people.  Stage 2 Land values increase and roads and other infrastructure developments begin. Outsiders beginbuying land and establishing their own operations on alarger scale than the locals. Local people still benefiteconomically, although the bulk of the income goes toa small number of people.  Stage 3 Hotel construction begins at a faster rate, planning regulations are ignored, and building pro-ceeds haphazardly, causing degradation of the environ-ment. Local people benefit as employees in the localhotels and lodges and in the transport sector.  Stage 4 Most hotel, bungalow and restaurant owners are from outside the local community. Money begins toflow out. Large developments are implemented withoutregard for regulations. Large hotels and organisationspromote international tourism, and profits stay in thecountry of origin. Tourists contribute small amounts ofmoney by buying souvenirs. Water supplies and theenvironment become endangered and developers fearfor the future. Local residents may begin to resenttourists.  Stage 5 Degradation of the environment sparks fears of a decrease in the volume of tourism and promptscalls for action. Remedial action is slow to take effect,and the degradation continues. The local communityhas benefited all along, but control has been takenover by outside developers, who may decide to aban-don the area and move somewhere else. 3.4 Tourism impacts on communities and culture 3.4.1. Models fail to capture the complexity of the tourism cycle because they assume a homogeneouscommunity, a rarity in real life. For example, in the later stages of the tourism cycle, models fail to showwhether the whole community is hostile to tourism orwhether only certain sections of the population sufferfrom and complain about the social impacts. The fact thathost community members adapt to tourism in variousways adds complexity to the problem. Another factor isthat tourism growth may occur alongside other changes,and the hosts behaviour may be a response to thesechanges more than to the changes brought by tourism. Also, while many studies have investigated general atti- tudes towards tourism in particular communities, fewhave looked into attitudes towards specific communitytourism products and services. A major research problemhas been that few studies have been designed on theadvice of those being affected. Only a few researchershave asked respondents to rate or assess the importanceof impacts cited by local people.3WH  manual1-ch3 311002 1444 Page 4 Tourism Impacts and Problems 33How Local Communities Can Lose Out on the Benefits of Tourism  Tourism may not attract sufficient visitors quickly enough to generate the quantities of revenue needed tomeet the economic expectations of the community. Thisresults from the competitive nature of tourism or thequality of resources in the communities. The inability tomeet community expectations can lead to disenchant-ment with the programme and the belief that the siteserves no useful purpose with the community, which is inturn less likely to engage in protection activities. Tourism can increase burdens on local populations with-out producing mitigating benefits. Tourism revenues oftenreach a different segment of the population than thosewho must bear the burden of diminishing resources. Most tourist spending  airfares, hotel and tour opera-tors fees  benefits foreign companies.  Locals may live in scattered small groups or villages andcommunication may be difficult, limiting fair distributionof economic revenues. Developers may deprive locals of anticipated economicbenefits, or local power relations may dictate who willbenefit from tourism opportunities. For example, well-connected individuals may monopolise opportunities toserve as guides or provide transport for visitors. Start-up credit may be difficult to obtain. A study inBelize showed that while local investors had extreme diffi-culty obtaining credit to start tourism businesses, thesame banks offered credit if the same investors enteredinto partnerships with foreign firms. Not all tourism activities have equal potential for com-munity involvement. Some more sophisticated activitiesneed specific training before a community can beinvolved. For example, small community-run hotel projectsmay be hampered by administrative and organisationalproblems resulting from a lack of business skills. InMexico, a cooperatively owned and run hotel projectfailed because cooperative members lacked training in thenecessary administrative skills to effectively run the busi-ness. In many cases providing opportunities for guiding inspecialised activities such as bird-watching or river raftingis not feasible. Ground operators prefer skilled, well-edu-cated guides from the capital city who speak English orother European languages. Tour companies and hotels, as a general policy, do notuse local guides. In attempts to rectify the situation insome countries, tour operators and hotels are required tohire under-skilled local guides under government rules orregulations or sometimes in the form of a protected areapolicy. Because these countries often have few competentlocal guides, tour operators resent being required to usethem, often seeing them as an additional financial drain. Because rural tourism is often seasonal, it tends not tocreate permanent employment. But the temporary jobs itoffers may compete with other seasonal jobs such as agri-cultural work, leaving no net gain for the community.3.4.2 Interaction between tourism development and a community has been shown to be difficult to pre-dict, with few consistent relationships or patterns.Following is an overview of findings on this complicatedissue. High tourism concentrations can be viewed as pos-itive by some communities and negative by others. Whilenegative attitudes are usually associated with high levelsof development, some communities support tourismdespite high resident-to-tourist ratios. Visitation to SharkBay, Western Australia, grew from 10,000 in 1984 to150,000 in 1990, boosting the resident-to-visitor ratiofrom 110 to 1150 in just six years. Despite the rapidgrowth rate and the emergence of serious environmentalproblems, residents remain positive about tourism andsupport its continued growth. Similarly, at Nadi, Fiji, wheretourism development and contact with tourists is alsohigh, the hosts remain positive in their reactions andattitudes. Some studies have found that residents are more likely to support tourism if they stand to benefit from it throughemployment for themselves or family members. Or theybelieve the benefits of tourism outweigh the negativeimpacts. Some studies show that people who do not benefit from tourism support the industry regardless. Some research has reported local concern over the impact of tourism development on property prices, access torecreation, traffic congestion, quality of life, salaries and higher prices. Other research shows little relationshipbetween tourism development and indicators such as thequality of life. Residents in the Austrian Alps reported thatwhile tourism had brought higher prices for basic necessi-ties, higher taxes and competition over the distribution ofbenefits, as well as decreased participation in communityprojects, the overall influence of tourism on the commu-nities was positive. 3.4.3 Some cultures can adapt positively to external influences while others cannot. Cultures and commu- nities with a history of interacting with other cultures anda gradual exposure to outside groups incorporate newpractices into their lives, safeguard their own cultures, andhave fewer difficulties with tourism. Groups that have hadlittle contact with outsiders have greater difficulty. Anextreme case is when Australian aborigines paid absolute-ly no attention to Captain Cooks ship the Endeavor in1770, finding it unclassifiable and too bizarre to contendwith. External influences can change some cultures in one or two generations. New patterns in a cultures social struc-ture, for example women working outside the traditionalfamily system, can weaken interest in cultural traditionssuch as storytelling. With new employment opportunities,young people may no longer want or need to learn tradi-tional skills. While in some cases tourists interest in localart, music and language may foster a cultural renaissance,3WH  manual1-ch3 311002 1444 Page 5 Tourism Impacts and Problems 34most often researchers report traditional cultures veering towards commodification. 3.4.4 Cultural commodification is the erosion of cul- tural practices until they become meaningless. In a tourism setting this develops as people and their culturalsymbols are treated as commodities that can be bought,changed or sold. As this occurs people begin to performexclusively for the tourists benefit, and events may losetheir value as a cultural and spiritual manifestation. Asa defensive mechanism some communities try to limittourists intrusion by keeping separate cultural manifesta-tions closed to tourists, and offering staged authenticityperformances to visitors, including appropriate interpreta-tion and explanations. 3.4.5 Community acceptance of tourism depends greatly on the extent to which the attraction reflectsthe needs and desires of local people and their inte-gration into the industry. Negative cultural change can be minimised if local people are able to participate intourist-related businesses and have a role in making deci-sions about the numbers and types of tourists enteringtheir communities, and at what frequency. Cultural andeconomic impacts are reduced where local groups havehad some autonomy over their land, where they havebeen integrated into the tourism industry. Access for locals to an attraction, and the perception that the attraction brings economic benefits through the cre-ation of jobs or additional income into the local economyare other factors contributing to community acceptance.Free access for locals is often seen as a positive develop-ment. Locals will tend to resent visitors if protected areaauthorities appear to be managing a site more for foreignand national visitors than for local people. 3.4.6 Conflicts arise when the economic benefits of tourism are unevenly distributed, especially whenresulting disparities in wealth are great. In the main settlement and administrative area of Taman NegaraNational Park, Malaysia, about 60 percent of the localpeople hold jobs in the tourist sector, earning much high-er salaries than the rest of the population. In neighbour-ing villages some 70 percent of the population live off theland, making about one-third of what the locals in themain settlement make. Tourism has created social ten-sions as locals resent higher boat fares and rising costs ofeveryday goods conflicts arise over the use of parkresources such as fish, fruit and rattan and illegal hunting and fishing are on the increase. 3.4.7 Distributing economic benefits to support local populations has been difficult for a number of rea-sons. In a study of protected areas with tourism pro- grammes, few generated substantial benefits for localpeople. Even in highly successful areas, few direct benefitswent to local communities. For example, whiletourists generate about 5 million annually at Khao YaiNational Park in Thailand, little of the revenue benefits thesurrounding communities. Tourism development in the Everest area of Nepal tends to be concentrated alongstrips, with little room for economic benefits to spread.Studies in some areas of Nepal showed that only the vil-lage elite were able to capture tourism benefits. 3.4.8 Economic development from tourism does not readily translate into community participation in conservation and protection actions. The reasons for this include the following  Economic benefits from tourism often create insufficient incentives for local communities to support conservationand protection.  Strategies for creating ownership of an economic devel- opment conservation programme are difficult to devel-op. Often, no mechanisms exist for providing incentivesfor conservation activities. Donors will often provideinfrastructure, schools, clinics, wells, etc., in areas out-side protected zones without consulting or engaginglocal communities. Since these initiatives are seen asgrants, people feel little responsibility for their futuremaintenance. Clearly they are unsustainable.  The link between tourism benefits and conservation activities may be unclear or nonexistent. For tourism topromote conservation, local people must benefit eco-nomically and see a clear link between the benefits andthe need to protect the resource. If benefits do not stayin local areas or are narrowly distributed, there is littlechance of making these important links. A study ofCosta Rican and Mexican nature guides revealed thateven though the guides were trained in ecology, no def-inite relationship was seen between their training andtheir participation in community conservation efforts.The study concluded that guides with demonstratedprior interest and experience in community conservationactivities should be identified and recruited. Case Study Komodo National Park, Indonesia At Komodo National Park, Indonesia, the guiding princi- ple is that local communities should have priority in deriv-ing benefits from the existence of the park. Localcommunities are involved in tourism activities, resourcemanagement and protection efforts. To some degree, res-idents are also involved in the provision of transportation,guide services and accommodation, while many makehandicrafts and souvenirs, or work at restaurants. 3.5 Implications and recommendations  Impacts must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Interactions resulting from tourism are difficult to predict onmany issues, with few consistent patterns or relationshipsemerging. For example, impacts on wildlife and a commu-nitys reaction to tourists vary according to the situation.3WH  manual1-ch3 311002 1444 Page 6 Tourism Impacts and Problems 35 The fact that impacts can be both curvilinear and vary from resource to resource reinforces the need for moni-toring programmes that can track changing trends.Finding the cause or causes of a problem provides man-agers with the necessary information to select indicatorsto track changes over time.  Locating tourism activities in areas where resources are both resistant and resilient helps limit damage. Resistanceand resilience factors may be described in backgroundinformation collected during the planning process, forexample concerning the vulnerability of certain wildlifespecies.  Evaluating a sites goals and objectives when deciding on the degree to which impacts should be controlled willinfluence tourism activities. For example, habituation maymake it easier for tourists to see wildlife but seriouslycompromise scientific study. If scientific investigation is amanagement objective, maintaining populations ofwildlife in a natural state will take precedence overtourism considerations.  Impacts that are visitor related should be analysed according to use patterns, types of user groups, groupsize, amount of use and mode of travel. Through suchanalysis, visitor groups and activities can be matched withproblem areas.  A communitys stability and structure have an important effect on its resilience. Essential factors to analyse includethe communitys ability to plan and its labour patterns,i.e., who is employed, in what capacity at what wagesand during which months. An early assessment should bemade of how a community can contribute or influencetourism development. Local communities need time todecide on their direction.  Identifying activities that use existing resources and skills will maximise the potential economic benefit of tourismdevelopment to the local community. Community projectssuch as small cooperative hotels could be considered, butcareful planning and support is needed. Attention shouldbe paid to whether certain tourist ventures may producewide differences in local salaries. These activities may notbe advisable.  Determining how tourism revenue is distributed -- whether most of it goes to a few individuals or families, orwhether it is distributed widely through purchases of localgoods or in the form of wages -- will reveal the econom-ic impact of tourism opportunities. The assessment of rev-enue distribution should take into account how tourismprojects interact with other economic opportunities with-in the family unit and the community for some, evenmodest revenues from tourism may be significant.  The need for an in-depth knowledge of the local culture for example, how people celebrate or how they withdrawor seek privacy during the planning and management of tourism programmes is widely acknowledged. Some cul-tures are especially vulnerable to the adverse effects oftourism. To generate tourism that enhances rather thanthreatens local heritage, managers may consider not somuch what tourists might want to see in the communitybut what residents are prepared to reveal about themselves.

Their participation in theplanning and management process is of paramountimportance. Tourism-related public participationissues form the basis of a checklist for managers whowish to avoid unnecessary conflicts. Knowledge ofthese issues is an essential prerequisite for effectivepublic participation, particularly when planningstakeholder meetings and setting up tourism advisory councils. 4.1 Why involve stakeholders in planning and management? 4.1.1 Involving stakeholders saves time and money. Conflicts between communities and conservation author-ities have shown that relying solely on law enforcement isless practical and more costly than involving interestgroups from the outset. Long experience in WorldHeritage tourism management has shown that projectswith limited local input are less productive and ultimatelymore expensive. 4.1.2 Failure to understand stakeholder positions can delay or block projects. Examples abound of proj- ects that were blocked because of a lack of effective com-munication with stakeholders. Construction of a culturalcentre on the South Pacific Island of Truk was blockedbecause the project officer failed to consult with the gov-ernor. Had he done so he would have discovered a con-flict between the governor and a local leader in the villagewhere the project was planned. Early attempts at ecosys-tem management in Yellowstone National Park in theUnited States were delayed because management startedformulating an overall regional plan before unifying thekey stakeholders. Learning from past problems, many sites now invest a considerable amount of time in meetings with key stake-holder groups, asking them to articulate their views anddefining issues to be examined together. Through suchdialogue and collaboration, site management becomesfamiliar with the various stakeholder positions regardingtourism issues and activities that could have an impact onthe site. 4.1.3 Stakeholders can inform managers about easi- ly misunderstood local cultural differences. Religious or cultural values are often of primary importance to com-munities and can go unnoticed if locals are not involved inthe planning and management process. For example,while site staff may legitimately regard certain valleys,rock formations or archaeological sites as natural or anthropological resources, such sites may be sacred to thehost communities. Fencing, boardwalks and other struc-tures built in such areas may be offensive to the local peo-ple and compromise the sites cultural value. Without local input such values may go unobserved, setting the stagefor future conflicts. At the Great Zimbabwe World Heritage Site in Zimbabwe, the creation of a living museum to bring in more visitorsmet with criticism and indifference. Local people thoughtthat the living museum misrepresented the site, was inap-propriate and reduced the sites historical and culturalimportance to just another attraction with little relevanceto peoples real identity. Since the living museum displayeda lifestyle very similar to that of the average Zimbabwean,few local people found the village to be of interest. 4.1.4 Stakeholders can help identify problem areas that may have been overlooked by the experts.Experts cannot always judge the perceptions, preferencesor priorities of host communities when evaluating localconditions. For example, Participatory Rural AppraisalsPRAs carried out in Ucchali, a site in Pakistan that is clas-sified as a protected wetland and is managed as a water-fowl sanctuary, revealed a mismatch between local viewsand experts perceptions. Experts assumed that the areaslakes were longstanding geographical features. The vil-lagers knew that increased rains had formed the lakesover the previous 50 years, and that the water had sub-merged prime agricultural land that had been owned bythe local villages for centuries. Local communities believedthat their land rights were neglected when projects wentahead to conserve the wetland. Another pitfall occurs when experts views are oriented towards narrow interests. In the wetland project inPakistan, scientists tended to focus on species of specialconcern for international conservation and the wetlandhabitat. The villagers had a wider view of the ecosystemthat made the connection between the forests, the water-shed, the areas land use history and their livelihoods.Also, complex phenomena such as birds migratory pat-terns, changes in water quality, sedimentation rates andgroundwater levels were locally monitored and wellunderstood. If the broader picture had been appreciated,more effective collaboration could have been fostered. 4.1.5 Stakeholders can provide useful input regard- ing desired conditions at a site. Effective visitor man- agement involves establishing limits negotiated with thestakeholders. Through tourism advisory boards or coun-cils, stakeholders can help managers to establish visitorconditions and set quantifiable standards for problemmanagement and impact limitation. Experience hasshown that stakeholder input is essential for developingrealistic policies and management objectives that will gain long-term support. For example, the community shouldbe encouraged to participate in decision-making on howmany and what type of tourists they would like to receive,andor areas that would be off-limits.4WH  manual1-ch4 311002 1455 Page 2 394.2 Challenges in stakeholder cooperation and public participation 4.2.1 Formulating a clear idea of different stake- holder groups can be difficult. Unravelling the identity and structure of different stakeholder groups can be timeconsuming and the results are not obvious. For example,different agencies can be involved in the management ofa site and have different goals and objectives. In manycases, several agencies control various sections of a pro-tected World Heritage site, each with its own manage-ment strategy. While sharing a common heritageresource, visitor management strategies and issues vary from one area to the next. Participatory Management Patan, Nepal Participatory management can foster better relations between a site and the local community. In addition,resources are managed in a more cost-effective way.Long-term protection may require major attitudinalchanges on the part of staff and all stakeholders. To find out what local people really wanted and needed, managers of a German development project in Patan, inNepals Kathmandu Valley, began by organising youngpeople into self-help groups for community action. Theyoung people reported a desire to study English. Anorganisational base was created in the form of English-language study groups. Soon, these groups becameactive in community development issues and their effortsmotivated others to participate in community actionsincluding the construction of community sanitation facili-ties and toilets. As community involvement increased,local businessmen and government leaders looked moreand more to tourism to help generate economic develop-ment opportunities and to help pay for restorationefforts. With this in mind they formed the Patan TourismDevelopment Organisation to help attract tourists to thecommunity. 4.2.2 Open discussion may be seen as a threat to ones power and control. Some stakeholders are unwill- ing to support wider participation, especially when it isseen as a threat to their authority. For example, managersmay accept a policy of openness and communication butmay resist supplying all pertinent information to interestgroups. This situation eventually creates a climate of dis-trust, limiting the site managers ability to deal with thepublic. 4.2.3 The most vocal critics can dominate the partic- ipation process. Many citizens view public participation as a means of influencing policies and decisions. Publichearings can become forums in which the most vocal crit-ics of a plan can dominate discussions and exclude othersfrom the process. This can happen if an organised lobbygroup is heavily represented. Some people with legitimateconcerns may be intimidated by a venue such as a meet- ing hall and be afraid to speak up. Alternative venues suchas community centres can facilitate a more comfortableexchange of ideas and encourage balanced communica-tion among stakeholders. 4.2.4 Large numbers of people may be overlooked because they are not as vocal as other groups. Any issue that generates public interest is subject to a widerange of opinion. While most people will have an opinion,many will not feel strongly about the issue. This largemajority risks being ignored. It may be felt that they arethe group that can be most influenced because they arenot very interested and are probably not well informed.The possibility of some event igniting the interest of thisless-interested majority should however not be underesti-mated. Consideration of these groups is essential toensuring long-term public support. 4.2.5 Hierarchical structures may inhibit stakeholder participation in decision making. In many societies the formal structure of institutions and organisations as wellas cultural norms may make it difficult to elicit the opin-ions of certain groups making stakeholder participation informal meetings impossible. A few powerful agenciesmay dominate, overwhelming other stakeholders andblocking cooperation. In some countries, the governmentis directly involved in the actual business of tourism, func-tioning as tour operators as well as making policy, whichmay lead to imbalances in stakeholder input. 4.2.6 Public participation may be more a form of appeasement than a way to solicit stakeholdersinput. Offering local communities the opportunity to par- ticipate raises expectations about acceptance of their sug-gestions. A government may try to guide a particularchoice either by representing only one opinion or by pro-posing a set of choices among which only one is tenable.Decisions may have already been made before public par-ticipation begins any changes may be minor with rela-tively small impacts. Before embarking on a participatoryplanning exercise, proponents have to be ready to changeoriginal plans according to the input received. 4.2.7 Overemphasis on involving stakeholder groups can lead to a failure to recognise certain effects onresources. Managers must understand how stakeholders perceive impacts and define acceptability. However, manystakeholder groups have limited knowledge about naturaland cultural resources and may be unaware of potentialnegative impacts. Visitors adapt to deteriorating environ-mental conditions, accepting degradation as theinevitable result of increasing visitation. The visitors whoare displeased by the degradation may not return and arenot captured by surveys and public involvement efforts.Other stakeholder groups may be concerned only witheconomic considerations that could outweigh the desireto protect resources. So, while public participation is nec-essary, over-reliance on public input can lead to inactionand a deterioration of conditions over time. With resourceInvolving Stakeholders The Benefits and Challenges of Public Participation 4WH  manual1-ch4 311002 1455 Page 3 40bases declining and the demand for recreation and tourist attractions on the rise, it is managers who must ultimate-ly decide the parameters of how much and what kinds oftourism activity are acceptable. 4.3 Factors promoting participation and effective communication 4.3.1 Trust enhances a groups willingness to partici- pate. Trust is the crucial element of successful public par- ticipation. Building trust and a willingness to participatedepends on several factors. Positive earlier interaction builds trust. The history of the experiences with, for example, a state government agencyinfluences the chances of fostering participation.Rebuilding relations between conservation authorities andlocal people after a history of policing and exclusion canbe difficult. H.S. Panwar, who taught at the WildlifeInstitute of India at Dehra Dun, reported that the main cri-teria of success in ecologically oriented development proj-ects were building trust and enrolling the full participationof local people in the planning and implementationprocess. Honouring commitments builds trust. Amboseli National Park in Kenya, La Amistad National Park in Costa Rica andPanama, and Yellowstone National Park in the UnitedStates have all had problems with local communities afterfunding cuts that forced policy changes. At Amboseli, alack of funding for maintaining pumps at watering facili-ties caused a gap in trust with park officials and impingedon the needs of local Maasai cattle herders. At La Amistadand Yellowstone, personnel and budget cuts took a finan-cial toll on the local communities. Gestures that show equality, for example, sharing infor- mation equally among stakeholders, promote trust. Fromits inception, the Great Barrier Reef project worked froma scientific information base, regularly issuing maps, dataand carefully prepared information to the public. Time is necessary to build trust. Many experts agree that more time and effort could be spent addressing the vari-ous agendas of interest groups. One researcher writes,Trust-building takes time. The history of rural develop-ment initiatives is littered with enough examples to indi-cate that such time is a resource well spent in terms ofeffective policy outcomes. A non-partisan image helps build trust with stakeholders. When a particular problem arises at a site, the site man-ager -- who is seen as a government official -- may bewise to ask a popular local personality to explain the mat-ter to the public. If time and money permit, credible sci-entific information can serve as non-partisan evidence toheighten public understanding of an issue and changepeoples minds. Yellowstone officials published pertinentscientific information, viewed as more neutral, in the dailynewspaper to advise the public about a project to reintro- duce wolves into the park. 4.3.2 A collective approach encourages public partic- ipation. A process calling for participation and collabora- tion has been found to be more conducive to consensusthan traditional methods involving expert planners only.Work in community extension projects has shown more progress in community relations when participatory meth-ods are used. Experts report that no point is too early inthe project cycle to begin inviting local participation. A participatory approach is beneficial in several ways While issues of power and control will not disappear cer- tain individuals will always be motivated to convert othersto their position the participatory process enhances com-munication by showing both the common ground and thedifferences between the stakeholder groups. The exerciseoften leads to compromise and a breakdown of defensivepositions. Consensus-Building The literature on mediation suggests that conflicts are best resolved when people who are not technically fluentin the issues nevertheless guide decision making.Sometimes stakeholders present technical arguments toboost their positions, which is when the mediator shouldseek agreement on the technical issues before developingpolicy options. Mixed sessions involving technical andnon-technical participants should be led by a mediatorwho can control the technical language and seek clarifica-tion on behalf of all participants. Mediation is a process in which a neutral person or per- sons who are not a party to a dispute help people settletheir differences through negotiation. It is a subtleprocess that can potentially backfire, during which media-tors try to separate positions from interests and avoid theperception of favouring one party over another. Collaboration is of key importance in building trust among stakeholders. Studies have shown that peoplewho participate in group decisions are more likely toimplement them. One expert describes consensus as fol-lows We all can live with X as a solution to a problemand we all agree to going along with whatever X requiresus to do. Basic tips for obtaining consensus include  Being frank and honest when expressing ideas  Avoiding judging ideas too quickly Being willing to compromise Examining decisions and problems systematically Agreeing at the outset what issue is being addressed, and your goal.Involving Stakeholders The Benefits and Challenges of Public Participation4WH  manual1-ch4 311002 1455 Page 4 41One of the best-known and most useful consensus-build- ing techniques is brainstorming followed by filtering seebelow. The technique involves six steps  Preparing for the session  Determining the brainstorming method to use Generating ideas Creating filters Applying filters Wrapping up the session Brainstorming involves two basic methods, freewheeling and round robin. With freewheeling, groups sponta-neously present and share ideas, which are duly recordedby a facilitator. The round-robin method is more struc-tured, with the facilitator asking group members for spe-cific ideas on the issue being discussed. This method isused more with reticent groups. Brainstorming seeks to generate as many ideas as possible. The exercise can end when  Everyone has had a chance to participate No more ideas are offered A last call for ideas has been made and Team members have been thanked for their input andtime. Once ideas are generated, filters criteria set by the group, such as cost and time constraints are created to screenthem. Participants will readily help identify filtering crite-ria, such as cost, time factors, availability of the necessaryresources, philosophical considerations, and acceptabilityto management and other stakeholders. The filters allow the facilitator to go through the list of ideas and cross off those that do not qualify. The final step in the process is to review the ideas that survived the filtering process, and define each of theseideas to make sure all team members agree. The groupshould also delegate a member to relate the informationto other groups or other stakeholders.  Evidence suggests that people are reluctant to divulge past difficulties. Informal communication systems such assurveys can help get people to reveal their interests andconcerns. Reports from the North Pennines TourismPartnership programme in England revealed that suchinformal communication helped to resolve issues betweenthe different groups.  Public involvement tends to build momentum towards collaborative implementation. As one researcher haspointed out, misunderstandings between groups, ratherthan a lack of information, is at the core of many socialdifficulties.4.4 Effective collaboration and communi- cation techniques 4.4.1 Participatory techniques such as rural appraisals allow local people to describe their envi-ronment. Participatory Rural Appraisals PRAs can facili- tate the exchange of informal information between localgovernment officials, NGO staff and local people. Thesemethods have proven capable of overcoming the prob-lems of listening and shaping an accurate assessment ofstakeholder concerns. The techniques help map out localresources, ways people make a living, trends in resource use, and the local costs and benefits of conservation andprotection. They are practical methods of encouraginglocal participation, fostering communication and makinga more accurate appraisal of local concerns. The utility ofthese methods has been demonstrated in many areas ofthe world, particularly in Pakistan and India. Participatorytechniques, including PRAs, can be used for both naturaland cultural sites. Participatory Environmental Mapping Technique The Participatory Environmental Mapping Technique lies at the heart of Participatory Rural Appraisals. The tech-nique involves asking local people to draw maps on theground. The exercise starts with an open-ended question,such as, Can you draw a map of your village? Usinglocal materials such as sticks, stones, grass, wood and cig-arette packets, or coloured chalk provided by the projectofficer, participants map out the village, often promptingdiscussion over the accuracy of the drawing. Since theprocess is participatory, and all the information is con-stantly visible to all participants, the technique avoids thepitfalls of the typical interview, in which someone maydominate the discussion. The mapping should be carried out in a low-key, relaxed atmosphere. The project officer may start off the mapwith a simple, obvious feature such as the main road orriver, or the next village, and then hand over the stick to alocal person to continue the map. This hand-over is oftenseen as an important symbolic action. Once participantsagree on the map, more open-ended questions stimulatefurther discussion. For example, Is the whole area thesame or are there differences? What else is importantto show on the map? Have I forgotten anything?Open-ended questions assure neutrality. Participants areasked to add their responses to the map. The project offi-cer should ask permission to copy the map into a note-book, explaining why and discussing the follow-up.Another technique is to distribute automatic cameras tocommunity members, explaining its use, and ask them tophotograph, over a couple of days, features and land-scapes they believe may be of interest to visitors a com-munity-based inventory of attractions. Kayapoamerindians in Brazil have used this process successfully. Involving Stakeholders The Benefits and Challenges of Public Participation 4WH  manual1-ch4 311002 1455 Page 5 42To improve data, different PRA methods are used and then compared with each other and against additionalinformation from villagers. Community specialists recom-mend that such information should always be comple-mented with other methods such as transect walks of thecommunity enabling a specialist to verify mapping accom-panied by locals. Comparison with scientific maps or pho-tos, participation in daily activities, and farmer-to-farmervisits are also recommended. Planning under any circumstances should be carried out slowly. Any work, however benign or well meaning,which appears to threaten local power structures will bechallenged. 4.4.2 Alternative forms of dialogue can help limit public confrontations. Public meetings can be ineffec- tive when the parties with the most vested interestsattend with the goal of pressing their particular causes.Less confrontational meeting structures can reduce suchundue influence and limit the posturing of interest groupsfor the press. During the controversial Yellowstone wolfreintroduction project, open houses were held where indi- vidual people could sit down in a relaxed atmosphere andtalk directly with representatives of the various agenciesinvolved. Special meetings were held to allow powerful interest groups to voice their opinions, but they were lis-tening sessions only. These were run by female park offi-cials, perceived as less threatening and non-partisan thanmale officials, and local police were hired to maintain order. Effective Meetings Meetings take up much of a site managers time. They are an important nearly daily way of forming relationshipswith stakeholder groups including foreign donors andtourism officials. An interactive method of running meet-ings entails agreement on how the meeting will go aboutsolving problems. Many management problems stem from the fact that people have difficulty listening and hearing what some-one else is really saying. While listening seems to be asimple and obvious skill, specialists say few people areeffective listeners. However, listening skills can be learned. The following are five ingredients of an effective meeting  A clearly defined and agreed role and responsibility for each participant.  A common focus on content A common focus on process A person responsible for maintaining an open and balanced conversational flow  A person responsible for protecting individuals from personal attackA meeting agenda should be sent to participants before- hand so they can prepare. Meetings should be planned to avoid the group attack syndrome, in which group members feel they will beattacked as soon as they speak. The key to resolvingproblems of authority and power is to use a facilitatorwhose role is to hold the group together, offer sugges-tions and wait for agreement on any particular issue. Thefacilitator keeps the group on track, ensuring that no onedominates the discussions. The facilitator must remainneutral, refraining from contributing ideas or judging theideas of others. The facilitator, the minute-taker and allother key participants should explain their roles at theoutset of a meeting. Meetings must be recorded, and minutes should be dis- tributed to the participants ahead of the following meet-ing. The recorder should avoid interpreting theproceedings without input from participants, and try toremain objective. Recording ideas without identifyingtheir source builds trust in the system and helps thegroup to accept ideas. During the meeting, flipcharts canbe used to provide an immediate record of what is said. 4.4.3 The process of developing a management plan can encourage the participation of stakeholders. The process can also be used to build consensus. However,instead of releasing draft management plans for publiccomment, planners should begin by identifying what isneeded from the public, and what a site can offer them inreturn. Plans and strategies should be developed slowly, be dynamic and adaptable, and be concise rather thanlengthy. Above all, they should be inclusive of all stake-holders. Examples of successful issue-based management planning include the great Smokey Mountains National Park in theUnited States, where many trails were in poor conditionand needed to be closed to have time to recover. Parkmanagers realised that closing trails would generate neg-ative sentiment. To educate the public about the situation,management decided to involve people in the process.Meetings were held to give people an understanding ofthe parks mission and to provide them with an opportu-nity to participate in setting priorities. At the Willandra Lakes Region World Heritage site, in Australia, a five-day workshop was held at which com-munity members helped write the first draft of a man-agement plan. The exercise guaranteed continuedsupport for the plan. At the Shark Bay World Heritage site,also in Australia, participatory management plans for con-servation areas are also made available for public com-ment for at least two months, a practice required underWestern Australian law.Involving Stakeholders The Benefits and Challenges of Public Participation4WH  manual1-ch4 311002 1455 Page 6 434.4.4 An advisory group or stakeholders organisa- tion can play a crucial role in the success of manage-ment objectives. Consultation with various interest groups through regular meetings and public workshopsoffers opportunities for stakeholders to comment on apreliminary management plan. This relationship enablessite managers to bring local people into decision-making.Ongoing conflicts will not necessarily go away, but anadvisory group provides a structure for the problem-solv-ing process so that conflicts and solutions can be identi-fied more clearly. Public participation is more likely to be effective and sus- tained through stakeholder groups than through individ-ual participation. At the Shark Bay World Heritage site, anadvisory committee played a major role in determiningappropriate and practical strategies for management ofthe reserves and the regions resources, including settingthe boundaries of the site. As was previously mentioned,Patan, a town in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, has a citi-zens advisory group developing a tourism programme toaid preservation of the communitys historic buildings. The Nominal Group Technique The nominal group technique NGT has proven valuable in visitor management. It involves forming discussiongroups of eight to 10 people of different backgrounds.Participants are asked to draw up lists of key concernsabout a project without consulting other group members.Using a round-robin procedure, participants itemise theirconcerns and then vote on their priorities. The technique has several advantages. The time taken to itemise concerns encourages thinking on the part of theparticipants. The format encourages full group participa-tion by preventing assertive people from dominating, as iscommon with focus groups. A three-stage approach for community tourism planning can be used. First, key community leaders are inter-viewed. Using the issues identified, a random sample ofcommunity members can be surveyed. Finally a nominalgroup and a focus group can be used to determine thecommunitys preferences concerning tourism. The NGT is useful for dealing with sensitive and contro- versial or prominent issues, when conflicting opinions andcomplex details may impede dialogue. Using the NGT, thefirst round is silent, giving people a chance to enter theirideas without having to speak. The NGT also gives peoplean equal opportunity to speak regardless of social statusor personality. The technique is especially useful whenmany alternative solutions to a problem are possible. The NGT consists of six steps  Defining problems to be solved or decisions to be made  Silently listing ideas Stating and recording ideas  Clarifying each item on the list Ranking listed items silently Closing the session Participants should be given a time limit for generating ideas, or a maximum number of ideas, perhaps 10 or 12.The group members take turns stating ideas from theirlists, and a recorder writes them on a flipchart or chalk-board. At this stage in the process the ideas are not dis-cussed. Items are not duplicated, and if any ideas arecombined, the facilitator and recorder make sure thateveryone in the group agrees on the arrangement. Eachlisted item is discussed to clarify its meaning. The groupfacilitator assigns a letter to each of the ideas. Then eachteam member, using his or her own list, ranks the ideas. The group may decide to rank only the top five ideas. Longer lists may be reduced using the half plus one rulei.e., 30 items would be cut to 16. To tally the results,each participant calls out his or her rankings. The recorderlists the results. The top-ranked items represent theteams decision up to that point, before any discussion ofthe merits of the ideas. An open discussion is held to determine whether the decision is consistent with everyones thinking, and toconsider items that may have received too few or toomany votes. If things seem really inconsistent anothervote can take place. After this step people can be taskedwith the next steps in a plan for implementation oraction. At Tangariro National Park in New Zealand, a Maori burial site became a popular rock-climbing area. Because thisuse of the site was of great concern to the Maori, meet-ings were held between the climbers and tribal elders withthe result that the climbers agreed to practise voluntaryrestraint in using the area. 4.4.5 Local NGOs can serve as a liaison for more effective and sustained participation. Non-govern- mental organisations NGOs can play an important role inlinking tourism stakeholders. NGOs can act as intermedi-aries between the private sector and local interests. Insome countries NGOs with computers and communica-tions equipment can serve as links between stakeholderswithout such resources. There is reason to believe thatNGOs prestige can bring added pressure to bear in nego-tiations with private tourism companies. Grass-Roots Tourism Organisation in Patan, Nepal Local tourism officials realise that for successful long-term restoration and protection efforts, they need key stake-holders, coordinated by a local tourism organisation, tocarry out the programme, assure long-term support from Involving Stakeholders The Benefits and Challenges of Public Participation 4WH  manual1-ch4 311002 1455 Page 7 44government, raise tourism demand, set mechanisms to collect tourism charges and voluntary contributions, andinvolve local residents directly in tourism businesses. Because of the need to implement practical programmes on their own, the Municipality of Patan and local busi-nessmen created a grass-roots tourism organisation. Theyare now developing local tourism to help finance local ini-tiatives and solve local problems. Specific actions includethe production of local promotional materials, the use ofguidebooks, walking tours of the community and projectsto restore local houses. Such community developmentprojects rely on the full range of stakeholders. Notably,tourism can be used to revitalise old communities and payfor the restoration of historic buildings. Success rates havevaried from one country to another. 4.5 Implications and recommendations Building confidence and trust requires time, energy and organisational capacity. In selecting or designing projects,sufficient time should be allowed for consensus-buildinginvolving local decision-making. The potential for follow-up on promises should be eval- uated before project strategies are implemented. If fol-low-up is unlikely and promises cannot be kept, projectsshould be modified or dropped. Past interactions shape a groups trust level. Therefore, knowledge of past interactions will help determine thetime and effort that will be needed to develop an effec-tive working relationship. Experts who are not part of a local culture cannot always judge local perceptions, preferences or priorities, andshould not necessarily be expected to provide such infor-mation. The ideals of representation and responsiveness are reached differently in different contexts. Effective plan- ning is often hampered by a lack of understanding of thehard realities of the political and economic context.Compiling a complete list of stakeholders and the variousaffinities and conflicts within the interest groups can be auseful first step in analysing site issues. This evaluationshould be carried out with stakeholders including govern-ment agencies at all levels, conservation groups, develop-ers and local communities. Suggested Activities 1.Create a preliminary list of the sites stakeholders and their concerns.  Sort stakeholders into categories, for example, tour operators, local businesses etc.  Identify the concerns of the different groups.  Develop a matrix showing where they overlap. 2.Develop a list of benefits and obstacles related to tourism planning and stakeholder interests.  Review the sustainable tourism planning process develop goals, objectives and a monitoring programmeas described in this manual. Discuss the perceived obstacles and benefits to thisprocess for each of the identified stakeholder groupsdescribe how they will influence tourism planning. 3.Develop a public participation programme.  Review past attempts to involve the groups and the lessons learned about public participation. Review each stakeholders role in the planningprocess. Hold a brainstorming session with staff to plan forpublic participation with reference to the lessonslearned and the information in this manual.

Settinggoals and objectives is also the key to success forother programmes including interpretation, promo-tion and carrying capacity assessment. Detailed man-agement objectives are essential for settingmonitoring standards. 5.1 Policy goals and management objec- tives Policy goals are broad statements that set out a vision of how a site will be managed on the basis of its environ-mental and social conditions. Policies guide a variety ofactions including building infrastructure and developingsocial programmes such as promoting local educationaland economic development through tourism. Where thispolicy development process is a joint exercise, a policystatement can unite people with different viewpoints andgive direction to public and private tourism management. The general nature of policy goals is reflected in a policy statement from the Australia Wet Tropics ManagementAuthority. It says the Authoritys purpose is to provide forthe implementation of Australias international duty forthe protection, conservation, presentation, rehabilitationand transmission to future generations of the Wet Tropicsof Queensland World Heritage Area, within the meaningof the World Heritage Convention. While policy goals are general, management objectives set out in detail how a site will be managed. Within theframework of the general policy goals, the objectives spellout desired conditions, reflecting what managementwants to maintain and the experiences a visitor would ide-ally encounter at a site. For example, if a policy goal is toprovide local employment opportunities, then a manage-ment objective may be to encourage the use of localguides. If a goal is to maintain a sacred site in a mannerensuring respect and tranquillity, then objectives mayinclude limiting visitation and noise levels. Objectives should be subject to evaluation. They should therefore be specific, quantifiable, have time limits and bestated in clear language so that they can be understoodby all those responsible for implementation. They shouldbe the basis for a standard by which to gauge the per-formance of site management. For example, at a histori-cal monument, a policy goal may be to support localeducational activities, while a management objectivecould be to increase the number of local schoolchildrenwho attend the sites educational programme. In this casea quantifiable measure could be the number of schoolgroups that visit the site during the year.Examples of Policy Goals  Generate and sustain local employment, revenue and development. Ensure that all activities permitted at the site are in har-mony with nature and with the history of the area. Provide opportunities for research that will benefit society. Educate visitors and the local community to enhanceappreciation of the sites values and inspire considerateattitudes towards the natural andor cultural environment.  Provide infrastructure for visitor safety, the protection ofthe sites natural environment or the recovery and protec-tion of threatened and endangered species. Clearly stated policy goals and objectives provide direction in decision making and responding to change.Constructing a tramway through a wilderness park, build-ing a high-rise modern hotel near a low-lying archaeolog-ical site, installing artificial lights at a monument, andincreasing helicopter traffic in a national park are all exam-ples of tourism initiatives that World Heritage site man-agers have had to face. Clearly documented goals andobjectives give direction and provide a historical contextfor addressing tourism initiatives in a consistent manner.Any new initiative can change a site. Examining initiativeswithin the context of policies and objectives can helpmanagers determine whether they are within acceptableparameters. If goals and objectives are based on stake-holder needs, and fall within the law and the WorldHeritage Convention, they can form a solid basis for man-agement decision making. In addition, activities such asinterpretation, promotion, carrying capacity control andmonitoring all depend on the direction given by policygoals and objectives. A project in the Carpathian Mountains in Eastern Europe illustrates the need for clearly defined tourism policygoals. An international funding agency assigned a teamof experts to write a regional tourism development plan toaid small businesses. Market research suggested a com-parative advantage for small-scale accommodations,emphasising natural and cultural attractions. Some mem-bers of the government and business community, howev-er, favoured the rebuilding of large-scale tourisminfrastructure from the Soviet era. At the time, no unifiednational or regional policies for tourism developmentexisted to give direction to and clarify these efforts. Thedisparity of goals persisted throughout the life of the proj-ect. When the time came to present a final report, theteam found it impossible to present strategy and cost rec-ommendations that met the needs of both groups. A forest reserve in Costa Rica whose operational budget is largely based on visitor fees had no clear-cut policies ontourism development until several years ago. A project tobuild a larger visitor centre met with opposition fromsome in the administration because they saw the sitemore as a nature reserve than as a tourist destination. 55WH  manual1-ch5 311002 1458 Page 2 Setting Policy Goals and Management Objectives 47Others liked the idea and wanted to attract more tourists. While members of the community were against it, peoplein other nearby communities were in favour of increasingtourism because of the economic benefits it would bring.After months of controversy, the issue was resolved witha consultants study and dialogue among the differentstakeholder groups. With an established process withinthe reserves administration to discuss policies and definegoals, these conflicts would have been minimised and nodoubt resolved without outside help. Setting Management Policy and Objectives A case for a well-defined, written policy When Keoladeo National Park World Heritage site in India began recruiting new local guides in 1996, the seniorguides were concerned that the newcomers wouldthreaten their incomes and lower guiding standards. Theytook the park authorities to court over charges of nepo-tism, and the park responded by pointing to its statedpolicy goal of supporting the rural poor. Determining categories of visitors as a planning toolThe same park had a policy of encouraging Indian nation- als to visit as well as generating local economic benefits.It was determined to encourage the following categoriesof visitors  People from New Delhi and other states Local tourists from adjacent districts People from the nearest town and surrounding vil- lages and towns  Students from the immediate area and nearby towns Foreign tourists Serious bird-watchers who stay for a week or so Annual visitors from both within India and abroad Setting fees on the basis of goals and objectivesPolicy goals can guide the setting of entrance fees. In this case, the park authorities wanted to generate more rev-enue to support local development projects, but they hadto avoid maximising the fees, fearing that such a policymight lead to charges of elitism, conflict with their educa-tional objectives, and possibly a loss of local political sup-port. They opted for a multi-tiered policy, substantiallyraising the entrance fee for foreign visitors while reducingit for local visitors, and creating a weekly pass for seriousbird-watchers. To determine the new fees, they conduct-ed a willingness-to-pay survey. 5.2 Issues of cultural authenticity and natural integrity 5.2.1 The cultural authenticity andor natural integrity of a site must be considered when devel-oping tourism policy goals and objectives. If heritage becomes a commodity, serious questions may arise withrespect to these two issues. A tourism marketing process may fail to focus on a sites true cultural traditions or his-torical interpretation and instead package it using animagined sense of character. World Heritage cultural sites,many incapable of accommodating large volumes oftourists, may use inappropriate modern materials andstyles when trying to increase capacity. For example, theArchaeological Survey of India ruled out lighting thegrounds of the Taj Mahal. Lights would have made it eas-ier for evening visitors but would have taken away fromthe experience of seeing the monument by moonlight. A historic town in the United States was practically desert- ed, raising the question of whether to let the culturalresource continue its natural decline or intervene to restore the site for more intensive tourism. Unfortunately, no old photographs remained from the towns heyday,and experts feared a misrepresentation of the past ifrestoration was carried out. The state historical society recommended managing the site to permit the towns natural deterioration. Major restorations were rejected infavour of simple shoring and bracing. To accommodatetourism needs, minimal construction activities were rec-ommended including parking, footpaths and signage. The local historical society, however, recommended that the town be completely restored. It favoured more inten-sive tourism and was not concerned with philosophicalissues and the consequences of intervention. In the end,the town was restored but with doubts remaining overwhether the quality, character and authenticity of the sitewas compromised. Practically, policy decisions are often heavily influenced by economic considerations. A decision on maintaining thevalues of ancient ruins in relation to the extent to whichstabilisation and conservation is carried out may be afunction of the funds and personnel available. Allowingvisitors to view a ruin from a distance may be more prac-tical and preferable than the more expensive option ofstructurally stabilising the site to permit visitor access. Insome cases all that may be needed is vegetation controlto reduce deterioration. 5.2.2 At World Heritage sites, policies and objectives must be in line with original integrity or authentici-ty values. When developing tourism policies at World Heritage sites, the overriding priority is to maintain theform and fabric of the resource. The nomination dossierof a World Heritage site can give guidance to the processof balancing policy and management objectives againsttourism needs. These dossiers usually describe a sites features and previous changes in detail and may set outnecessary preservation actions. Dossiers are availablethrough each countrys State Party andor through theWorld Heritage Centre. If the information is not detailed enough or if questions continue to arise, managers canseek advice on authenticity and integrity problems fromthe World Heritage Centre and its advisory bodies, IUCN,ICOMOS and ICCROM.55WH  manual1-ch5 311002 1458 Page 3 Setting Policy Goals and Management Objectives 485.3 Stakeholder concerns and developing policy goals and objectives 5.3.1 Stakeholder concerns should make up the list of management issues from which policy goals andobjectives are developed. Stakeholders involvement in setting goals and objectives links a tourism strategy withthose who will have an impact on a site now and in thefuture. Stakeholders can be consulted on a number ofmanagement concerns such as infrastructure develop-ment and monitoring programmes. Stakeholders usuallyinclude government officials, members of the environ-mental and conservation community, scientists, historicpreservation organisations, hotel and tour agency owners,visitors, guides and residents. Following is a list of stakeholders with suggestions on how they may contribute to developing tourism goals andobjectives.  Park, forestry or archaeological department officials may provide information on past management and visitorissues.  Guides can offer information on the social and environ- mental conditions of the site, and their input can bring to light important interpretation issues.  Guides working for tourist agencies can give advice on their employers concerns and input on site monitoringneeds. Principles of the ICOMOS International Cultural Tourism Charter Policy statements may be based on the following principles  Since domestic and international tourism are among the foremost vehicles for cultural exchange, conserva-tion should provide responsible and well managedopportunities for members of the host community andvisitors to experience and understand that communitysheritage and culture at first hand.  The relationship between heritage places and tourism is dynamic and may involve conflicting values. It shouldbe managed in a sustainable way for present andfuture generations.  Conservation and tourism planning for heritage places should ensure that the visitor experience would beworthwhile, satisfying and enjoyable.  Host communities and indigenous peoples should be involved in planning for conservation and tourism.  Tourism and conservation activities should benefit the host community.  Tourism promotion programmes should protect and enhance natural and cultural heritage characteristics. Note The full text of the Charter appears as Appendix 2. Community leaders often have concerns and ideas about how tourism will affect local social values and eco-nomic development. For example, local leaders may thinkit necessary to avoid tourism impacts on the main popu-lation centre.  Hotel owners can have a direct influence on tourism development and community interactions. They may beconcerned about potential crowding, or coordinating vis-itor arrivals between the hotel and site management per-sonnel through a reservation system. Hotel owners canalso help in the development of interpretation and pro-motional materials.  Tour operators will have concerns about visitor comfort and security. They stay apprised of changes in the inter-national travel market and usually have information onuser preferences and demand. The value of contactingtour operators to discuss their concerns, potentialdemand for a site, and possible cooperation on activitiessuch as marketing should not be underestimated.  Scientists can spell out concerns about significant flora and fauna or historical or archaeological remains. Theycan suggest ways to protect resources from impacts andoffer advice on attracting research grants. Field assistantsworking directly with scientists can share practical con-cerns and complementary information. 5.3.2 Background information should supplement the list of stakeholder concerns. When developing goals and objectives, libraries and department archives areuseful sources of valuable supplemental information, forexample on endemic or endangered species of fauna orflora, or on visitor use and impacts on wildlife or archae-ological ruins. National tourism and protected area lawsand policies including the legal requirements for licensingand taxation can help in setting government policies andin understanding current conditions of tourism develop-ment. Old master plans and the recommendations con-tained in them are also useful. At Copan, a Mayan WorldHeritage archaeological site in Honduras, a major interna-tional hotel was built even though many had suggestedthat smaller existing hotels in a nearby town would havebeen adequate with some minor upgrading. Many unat-tended ruins were destroyed just because they lay near anew access road to the Copan ruins. 5.4 Identifying common interests with stakeholders 5.4.1 Conflicts with the local community may pre- vent cooperation in tourism development. For this reason consultation with community members during planning is essential. They may voice concerns that devel-opment will bring increased pollution or crime that tourist traffic may endanger their children or that touristswill have a negative impact on social conditions, for example by wearing inappropriate dress. They also mayfear that the development will not benefit local people,for example that jobs as guides will be given to outsiders.5WH  manual1-ch5 311002 1458 Page 4 Setting Policy Goals and Management Objectives 49Consultations may result in actions such as the creation of a tourism development committee or a system for traininglocal guides. Tour operators may be asked to educate theirclients to respect community values. A visitor centre maybe built some distance away from the village to avoidencroaching on everyday village life. 5.4.2 Environmentalists and conservationists have important concerns over the potential negativeimpacts of tourism development on natural and cul-tural sites. Environmentalists involved in the protection of flora and fauna may fear that opening an area fortourism could also invite hunters, or they may voice con-cern over potential disturbances to nesting birds, forexample. Archaeologists might warn against vandalismand other potential damage to ruins and monuments.Both groups may complain about increased litter, particu-larly if existing funds are insufficient for garbage collec-tion. Both are likely to press for conditions in whichvisitors do not feel rushed or crowded, or spend too muchtime waiting to enter a site. Members of this stakeholdergroup often complain of a lack of communication withthe tourism sector, including both the ministry and privateoperators. They may also complain that staff membersvalue tourism development more than educational activi-ties and scientific research. This stakeholder group might wish to persuade site man- agers to implement an efficient reservation system, tolimit access to areas with pristine, fragile ecosystems or tovulnerable archaeological sites, and to mount an educa-tion campaign to minimise impacts. They might insist onstrict supervision of visitors, especially student sciencegroups. Researchers often advocate the appointment of ascience adviser at the site who could promote and man-age research. Agreement could be reached on specific tar-gets for tourism promotion and development. 5.4.3 Tour guides are a valuable source of informa- tion and advice concerning conditions affecting theenvironment as well as the visitor experience. They will point out unsafe trail sections and help ensure thattrails are maintained for comfortable walking, as well asalert management to problems of crowding and noise.Guides can inform management when local people usethe site for hunting and killing birds and other wildlife. Like the environmentalists and conservationists, guides are usually concerned about the quality of their clientsexperience, and will insist that the time it takes to pur-chase a ticket be kept to a minimum, that congestion onthe access road to the site be eliminated, and so on. They may suggest maintaining limits on the numbers of visitors permitted at a site through use of an effective reservation system, and measures such as staggering visits by pro-moting afternoon tours. A direct telephone or radio con-nection between site management staff and guideswould ensure consistent and effective communication.5.4.4 Hotel owners and managers usually want a site to provide a broad base of opportunities for differ-ent types of visitors. They are also concerned about crowding and littering, the amount of parking at the siteentrance, and the presence of persistent beggars andorsouvenir hawkers. As with independent guides, hotelsappreciate consistent and reliable communication withsite management, perhaps by a specially installed directphone line. Members of this stakeholder group might ask staff man- agement to develop a reservation system for tours. Theywould also advocate formation of a tourism advisory com-mittee to meet with the local community about develop-ment issues and the needs and preferences of tourists. 5.4.5 Overseas tour operators and ground operators are especially concerned about logistical questions.Will their tour groups have to wait in line behind other tours scheduled at the same time? Will their groups meetup with noisy or inconsiderate groups? Is there enoughparking? And, as with other shareholder groups, opera-tors are anxious for a site to be well maintained and safefor visitors, and in the case of natural sites that the wildlifeare adequately protected. These stakeholders often advo-cate efficient reservation systems, good communicationsand regular maintenance. 5.4.6. A stakeholder advisory group can facilitate the development of policy goals and managementobjectives. Such a panel provides a mechanism for exchanging ideas and information. The group shoulddraft a written policy or vision statement that can bedeveloped and publicly endorsed. The group could alsohelp to set management objectives, including standardsfor desired conditions and actions. Practically, stakeholder groups can be engaged in the management process and serve as forums for exchangingviews and reaching agreement on tourism issues. If anadvisory group is not feasible, some mechanism forexchanging ideas is needed. This can be as simple as aregular exchange of memos between site management staff and stakeholder groups, to solicit opinions anddescribe current activities. The process of developing goals and objectives should also take into account the sites uniqueness in relation toother sites with which it competes. Tour operators andother tourism professionals who may be members of theadvisory group can be a valuable source of information about a sites comparative advantage over others in the area. 5.5 Visitors preferences and demand 5.5.1 Data about visitors preferences and demandfor a site is essential for establishing objectives.Information on the number of visitors and their likes, dis-likes, motivations and expectations will help the planner5WH  manual1-ch5 311002 1458 Page 5 Setting Policy Goals and Management Objectives 50divide visitors into subgroups of people with similar char- acteristics, needs and spending behaviours. This informa-tion is useful in setting objectives for infrastructure,personnel needs and education and interpretation pro-grammes. Combined with data on tourism markets, theinformation can be used to develop objectives for attract-ing certain types of tourists to a site. For example, man-agers with a policy of boosting local communitydevelopment might set a goal of attracting tour operatorswho use local guides. 5.5.2 Numbers of visitors also affect management objectives and infrastructure and facility design. The experience at Liffey Falls in Tasmania illustrates the useful-ness of information about visitor preferences when settingmanagement objectives. The Forestry Commission discov-ered that visitors wanted to see the falls and were notinterested in the other available recreation facilities.Knowing this, officials were able to concentrate theirefforts and save a considerable amount of money andstaff time. At Uluru National Park in Australia, a survey found that most tourists mainly wanted to see and to climb AyersRock. Fewer cited experiencing the outback and seeingwildlife as prime reasons for visiting. This informationhelped park staff to focus their attention on Ayers Rock. 5.5.3 Existing sources can be used to start the process of assessing visitor preferences anddemand. Information and statistics from the tourism min- istry, protected area staff and tour operators can help pro-vide an idea of current and future demand and the mix ofmarket segments. National tourism officials have informa-tion on tourism development and studies or statistics ontourism markets. Statistics and reports from the site staffand tour operators can provide an idea of visitor prefer-ences and demand. Existing studies from national tourismofficials can provide information on the kinds of touriststhe government is attempting to attract and the type oftourist expected to visit a site in the future. Interviews withretired parks, forestry or archaeological survey officials may shed light on past management plans and visitationrecords. Records may include statistics on the number of park visitors, their country of origin and the number ofdays they spend in the area. Through discussions, officialscan help managers identify changes in visitor interests,activities and travel patterns. A look at tourism development in neighbouring commu- nities can indicate a sites potential demand and showhow tourism has affected the economies and social con-ditions of the community. Local guides and hotel and pension owners can provide information on visitor prefer-ences and demand cycles. Also, because they are in con-stant touch with changes in the international travelmarkets, they can help in identifying and tracking userpreferences and demand, for example, whether visitorstravel in tours or organised groups or travel independent-ly. They can provide helpful information for developinginfrastructure and interpretation material. Scientists and archaeologists can also share information about visitorpreferences and patterns. 5.5.4 Observations, surveys and interviews provide more detailed visitor profiles. Such information on vis- itors and their interests may be needed to fine-tune man-agement objectives, for example, on crowdingpreferences or tourists spending patterns. Observationsare qualitative and less exact than surveys and interviews,but they are quick, inexpensive and useful for indicatingtrends or suggesting targets for an eventual survey orinterview. Observations may include organisation group size, forms of transportation, type and amount of equipment,uses of time, maps of where people go and behaviourincluding languages used and noise levels. Since mostpeople have difficulty analysing their own behaviour andmotivations, observations can be a quick and useful tech-nique for monitoring what people actually do. Planning and Conducting Surveys OBJECTIVES The first step in successful surveying is reaching a clear understanding of the purpose of the exercise, which willhave a bearing on the choice of data-gathering tech-nique, survey design and the fieldwork itself. Followingare examples of survey objectives to evaluate an interpretation or promotional pro- gramme  to evaluate the number and types of tourists visiting the area in order to justify an application for funding orassess the effectiveness of an investment  to measure visitors willingness to pay, in order to set a realistic entrance fee  to assess visitor preferences regarding existing and con- templated recreational activities ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  Surveyors should be open and honest about the information being sought, such as data on visitors spending.  Respondents have the right to refuse to answer a ques- tion or stop answering questions at any time.  The researcher should guarantee confidentiality, or, if the data collected are to be published, the respondentshould give written consent. Personal information israrely necessary a mailing list of visitors can be com-piled separately from a survey.  The survey questions and procedure should take into account cross-cultural, ethnic or gender sensitivities. 5WH  manual1-ch5 311002 1458 Page 6 Setting Policy Goals and Management Objectives 51TYPES OF DATA Qualitative data can provide a rich body of descriptive information that can be used in its own right or to helpset the objectives of quantitative surveys. Methods forcollecting qualitative data include interviews, focusgroups and observation. A drawback is that qualitativedata are difficult to measure and require subjective judgement. Quantitative data can be collected in face-to-face or telephone interviews, or through questionnaires.Quantitative data are numerical and can be coded for sta-tistical analysis. Attitudes and opinions are measuredusing rating scales. While quantitative methods may sam-ple just a portion of the population, with statistical analy-sis they yield fairly reliable generalisations about thepopulation as a whole. One drawback of such data is thatthey can be impersonal and fail to reveal why visitors feelor behave the way they do. Another is that defects in sur-vey design or interviewing skills may lead to bias. Designfaults may also lead to the collection of a sample that isnot truly representative of the population under study. DATA-GATHERING TECHNIQUES Participant observation, conducted without overt con- tact with the subjects, can be used to gather qualitativeand quantitative data. The researcher becomes part of thegroup being observed and may make important discover-ies about visitor preferences. Such information could beuseful in the planning of a detailed survey, for example byhelping to identify categories of tourists. Face-to-face interviews are an occasion to ask in-depth questions on a particular subject. Respondents areallowed to answer freely without time constraints. Aswith participant observation, this exercise can be a prel-ude to developing a quantitative survey. Interviews areless prone to misunderstanding and avoid problems asso-ciated with illiteracy and language barriers. Follow-upquestions can correct for inadequate replies. Interviewsare especially useful when the subject is complex, andwhen privacy is needed to avoid peer pressure. The disad-vantages of interviews include that they are more labourintensive and costlier than other methods, and that inter-viewer bias is difficult to avoid. Focus groups hold facilitated discussions aimed at allow ing certain issues to emerge. A leader moderates the dis-cussion and records the results. Focus group discussions permit a wide range of responses and take less time over-all than in-depth interviews. The format allows observa-tion of the participants that can provide insights into their behaviours and attitudes. Self-completed questionnaires are cheaper than inter- views and can yield a great deal of information. Surveyforms may be stocked at strategic places, distributed along with entrance tickets or handed out to a sampling of the target group. The main disadvantage is that fol-low-up is not possible with individual respondents. 5.5.5 Interviews are more labour-intensive but can provide an in-depth view of a given situation.Interviews require specific training, and the results canvary according to the subjectivity of the interviewer. Face-to-face interviews using open-ended questions usuallyprovide a rich complement to quantitative data.Interviews are also valuable because they impart informa-tion to interviewees about site issues. Surveys are less expensive than face-to-face interviews, can reach a broad range of visitors and can provide valu-able quantitative data, which is useful for reinforcingmanagement decisions. However, with surveys communi-cation is only one-way, and they require skills in question-naire design and data management. They are also lesseffective than interviews in educating visitors. Ideally, acombination of methods should be used to determinepreferences and construct accurate visitor profiles. Categorising tourists according to preferences and behav- iours can contribute to the realisation of a sites goals andobjectives. For example, if income generation is a keygoal, information should be compiled on variations inspending by visitors. If education of schoolchildren is a pri-ority, they should figure in a survey. 5.6 Setting objectives at sites offering multiple activities 5.6.1 At large sites, whether cultural, natural or mixed, management objectives may vary from onearea to another within the site. People visit attractions with different expectations. Serious bird-watchers maycome to a site to see an endangered species in a seldomvisited, quiet environment. At the same time, local touristsmay come to the site to see an archaeological ruin and topicnic or socialise with family members, and they may benot be particularly bothered by noise levels. The Recreation Opportunity Spectrum ROS has proven a useful tool for setting objectives for these different visitorexperiences. The ROS is a means of describing howtourism and recreation will be managed for different areaswithin a site. It works under the assumption that certainactivities fit best in certain physical areas, for example,wilderness trekking fits better in relatively untouchedforests than in farming areas. It also assumes that activi-ties should provide visitors with certain experiences oropportunities, such as solitude or adventure. For example,on Tanzanias Mt. Kilimanjaro, planners created a hikingzone where numbers were restricted and visitors couldexpect infrequent contact with other walkers. An evenmore restricted wilderness zone allowed only very minimaluse. All huts and other permanent facilities wereremoved, only tent camping was permitted and the 5WH  manual1-ch5 311002 1458 Page 7 Setting Policy Goals and Management Objectives 52highest degree of solitude was provided, the area being free of permanent human presence. To separate different activities, the ROS system uses pre- established categories called opportunity classes thatmatch the sites physical resources with the activities bestsuited to them. For example at a mixed site, one area maybe managed for archaeological tourism and another forbird-watching. Opportunity classes set out the desiredconditions for the different areas and provide guidelinesfor management objectives. These include guidelines ontourismrecreation activities and infrastructure develop-ment. In the United States, parks and forest services use aset of predetermined opportunity classifications includingprimitive, semi-primitive non-motorised, semi-primitivemotorised, rural and modern urban. Other countries havedesigned their own categories to fit the physical realitiesof their particular region. Each classification entails man-agement standards and desired conditions that fall withina sites policy goals. The information needed to identifyand establish opportunity class areas is drawn from back-ground information on policy goals, existing legislationand stakeholder concerns. Each opportunity class encompasses a set of experiences and activities for the visitor. Each has guidelines for eco-logical, social and management conditions. For example,an area classified as primitive might be maintained as awild stretch of terrain where vehicles are not permittedand where visitors are highly likely to experience physicalchallenge and solitude. Because such areas appeal totourists seeking a wilderness experience, appropriateactivities may include sports such as backpacking andcanoeing. Moving across the spectrum, rural areas within a site, for example farmland, can have varying degrees of humanimpacts and contact with other people is to be expected.Here activities such as wilderness backpacking wouldprobably not be appropriate. On the other hand, bird-watching along rural roads may be an appropriate touristactivity. Infrastructure development for different activities is close- ly related to an areas opportunity class. The ROS systemmatches infrastructure objectives with the experiences onoffer. For example, if an objective is to provide an isolatedwilderness experience, only basic infrastructure would beneeded. In populated rural areas, infrastructure may bemore sophisticated, with accommodations that fit visitorsexpectations. 5.7 Implications and recommendations  When formulating goals and objectives, the first step isto determine the purpose of tourism at a site. Questions such as the following can stimulate thinking about thisissue Is the purpose solely to generate foreign exchange, orwill the site also be used to boost small local enterpris-es such as guiding or handicrafts?Will revenue be used to support the site, for example to pay for additional guards?How will the site look and how will it be managed? Will it give special opportunities for local employment and provide educational opportunities for local residents? Will the sites infrastructure design reflect the traditions of the area by using natural materials?  Collecting and organising information from available resources, including library or planning department archives, and noting areas where information is lackingcan save time and money. The exercise can facilitate thework of outside consultants and identify additional man-agement data that may be needed. The tourism ministry,protected area staff and tour operators can provide infor-mation and statistics on fragile areas, areas of specialinterest, existing visitor impact, current and futuredemand and the mix of market segments. This informa-tion is useful for making decisions on the siting, designand cost of infrastructure.  Familiarity with government tourism policies, current conditions of tourism development and studies or statistics on the countrys tourism markets, aids in thedevelopment of policies and management objectives.Management plans and visitation records, as well asaccounts of tourism problems and solutions, help to illu-minate environmental, cultural and archaeological condi-tions. Local guides are knowledgeable about social andenvironmental conditions and visitor preferences. Guidesworking for major tourist agencies and the owners andmanagers of hotels and pensions can give advice on man-agement concerns and visitor preferences. Tour operatorsfamiliar with international travel markets can also aid inidentifying and tracking user preferences and demand.  Stakeholder concerns should be analysed in terms of how they will affect management costs. For example,concerns may include protecting and viewing a particularspecies of wildlife or minimising crowding at a ruin site.With this information a manager can decide whether suf- ficient funds are available to bring about and maintain thedesired conditions.  The manager should determine current levels of usage by asking the following sorts of questions How manypeople visit the site? Are they local or foreign visitors?How do they gain access to the area and what do they dowhen they visit? What infrastructure already exists? Do existing attractions show signs of damage? Notes on siteconditions, with accompanying photographs, can help insetting management objectives and in future monitoringand interpretation work.  Listing the concerns and preferences of the various stakeholders will help analyse how these groups will influ-ence goals and objectives. Differences of opinion andareas of agreement between the groups should be clearlyidentified. The common links will be important for estab-lishing goals and objectives for development and man-5WH  manual1-ch5 311002 1458 Page 8 Setting Policy Goals and Management Objectives 53agement and provide clues to the type of monitoring needed.  Comments should be reviewed, discussed and written into a final document endorsed by all concerned partiesso that a common direction for tourism can be found. Apolicy statement will be the key to future decisions.Existing tourism definitions and policy documents such asthe ICOMOS Cultural Tourism Charter see Appendix 2can guide the formulation of site policies.  A stakeholder tourism advisory group made up of the various interest groups, tourism officials, local administra-tors, residents, site managers and others can be an impor-tant mechanism for the exchange of ideas. The groupshould meet regularly to discuss the purpose of the sitestourism programme and how will it be managed. Theprocess should yield consensus on a policy or vision state-ment. Pertinent questions include Does the site provide the opportunities for tourism that visitors want?Does the cost of providing those opportunities seemreasonable given the needs of the site and the different stakeholders?Are there differences among the various stakeholdergroups that would prevent the success of a project?  The ROS process should be used to map out the areas best suited to certain activities at large natural or mixednatural and cultural sites for discussion with the advisorygroup. Existing land use maps and baseline inventoryinformation will provide the tools necessary to get started.  An analysis of the comparative advantages of the site over neighbouring sites will help give direction to tourismgoals and objectives. These should reflect the qualitiesthat make the site competitive in the marketplace andmeet social and economic objectives. ROS classificationsshould also reflect these comparative advantages. Forexample, the site may have more isolated beaches than aneighbouring site, giving it an obvious comparativeadvantage. A management objective might be to installlittle infrastructure and keep visitation levels low, perhapsby charging a higher admission fee for the privilege ofusing the relatively untouched area. Suggested Activities 1.Analyse existing policy and management objectives  Review laws and policies including those at the national level related to visitor management  Review the site management plan and analyse previ-ous visitor management objectives Review the sites tourism experience to date, includingan outline of who has done what and the strengths andweaknesses of these efforts Identify gaps, i.e., what policies and objectives should be strengthened, and highlight future needs makingpreliminary suggestions on actions to meet these needs. 2.Gather visitor data  Determine whether visitors to a site are local residents or foreign tourists Determine how different groups use the site. Forexample, local residents may use springs for bathing,while foreigners may come to the same site to see afamous species of bird. Collect existing visitation statistics on use, trends, trav-el patterns and activities Develop and implement a visitor survey asking touriststheir perceptions and preferences and have them com-pare the site with neighbouring attractions identify vis-itor problems or areas of specific concern and add theseto the map Ask tour operators about tourist needs and prefer-ences and have them evaluate the site against neigh-bouring attractions. 3.Meet with individual stakeholder groups, in interviews or by holding workshops, and develop a draft paper onthe issues. Consult  community leaders to obtain their ideas for planning, tourism development in neighbouring communitiesand the types of skills available in the community  management and administration staff to identify their concerns and issues  local guides for their views of social and environmen- tal conditions at the site  scientists and researchers to learn more about the sites environmental and social conditions in relationto visitation impacts  hotel owners and managers for their views on man- agement problems, e.g., reservation systems andcommunication between the site and the hotels and  tour operators to determine tourists needs and preferences. 4.Form a tourism advisory group  Ask each stakeholder group to appoint a representative to the advisory group and arrange a practical system forinformation exchange  Supply the members with the draft issues and concerns and gain their consensual approval of the document  Outline the responsibilities of the tourism advisory group representatives. 5.Write tourism policies  Develop visitor management policies in coordination with the advisory group. Base discussions on site policyneeds, management parameters, stakeholder concerns,the sites comparative advantage, and existing legisla-tion and international conventions5WH  manual1-ch5 311002 1458 Page 9 Setting Policy Goals and Management Objectives 54 Generate consensus on the types and amount of visi- tation desired Have the policyvision statement publicly endorsed. 6.Develop management objectives  Review the vision statement, stakeholder concerns and management preferences with the tourism adviso-ry group  If appropriate, and considering the sites comparativeadvantages, use the map developed in the precedingsteps to identify and map different ROS opportunityclasses Reach a consensus on management objectives foreither the whole site or each opportunity class, if ROS isbeing used plan infrastructure development for activi-ties accordingly.

ThorsellIUCN6 55WH  manual1-ch6 311002 1500 Page 1 Carrying Capacity and Related Planning Issues 56Understanding the subject of carrying capacity is essential for planning and decision making.Understanding the limitations of the concept andknowledge of methodologies that have replaced it isessential not only for implementing practical man-agement plans but also for evaluating suggestedprojects. These methodologies generate impact indi-cators and standards that are linked to site policygoals and management objectives. They are essentialfor determining when undesirable change is takingplace at a site. 6.1 General carrying capacity issues 6.1.1 The concept of carrying capacity addresses thequestion of how many people can be permitted intoan area without risk of degrading the site and thevisitors experience of it. It has generally been broken down into three categories physical, ecological andsocial.  Physical carrying capacity, called facility carrying capac- ity by the World Tourism Organisation, mostly has to dowith available space the number of beds available toovernight guests, how many cars would fill a parking lot,how many campers in a campground, seats in a theatre,and so on. Concomitant to such considerations is thequestion of fresh water and electricity supply.  Ecological carrying capacity is the degree to which anecosystem is able to tolerate human interference whilemaintaining sustainable functioning. As noted in Chapter3 a curvilinear relationship may exist between use andimpact at a site, and wide variations in ecosystem resist-ance and resilience make ecological carrying capacity dif-ficult to predict. Social carrying capacity is psychological and socio-cul-tural and refers to the limit beyond which the number ofpeople in an available space would cause a decline in thequality of the recreational experience and the users satis-faction. Overcrowding is a prime example of a socio-cul-tural carrying capacity issue. Since different user groupshave different social expectations and because of compli-cated issues related to cultural resistance and resilience,this factor is also difficult to assess. 6.1.2 The concept of carrying capacity has evolved completely with a better understanding of the rela-tionship between the number of visitors and theimpacts they cause. During the 1960s and 1970s, the main focus was on developing a system for setting limitsto the number of visitors to parks, monuments and pro-tected areas as a means of safeguarding natural and cul-tural resources. The aim was to determine the point atwhich adverse impacts were likely to begin. Experiencehas shown that such a simple calculation is not feasible.Several factors are involved The onset of environmental deterioration or adverse social impacts may come sooner or later depending on varia-tions in visitor behaviour or the resistance and resilience of a given ecosystem. One destructive tourist can cause moredamage than 50 conscientious visitors. Some areas suchas meadows can handle less use than areas with moreresilient vegetation just a handful of tourists in a commu- nity may be responsible for most of the litter some com-munities may accept larger groups of tourists while othersreject them, and so on. For some individuals, a single fel- low visitor at an archaeological site would be too manyfor others, hundreds of fellow visitors would not diminishthe quality of the experience. Setting a specific carrying capacity figure may give the false impression that a protected area is safeguardedwhen it is not. Visitors to a ruin site may be limited to 100at a time, while in an isolated corner some visitors may behelping themselves to priceless souvenirs. The carryingcapacity of a nature trail may be set at 100, but that willnot prevent some visitors from disturbing a colony of nest-ing birds as they approach to take photographs. All activities cause environmental and social impacts. Site managers must set well defined and established goals fordesired conditions that will serve as a baseline for deter-mining an acceptable level of impact. For example, man-agers need to know how much litter is dropped along aninterpretive trail before launching a visitor education cam-paign against littering, so that they can determinewhether their efforts are succeeding. When visitors to anatural area desire an experience relatively free of fellowvisitors, managers may establish a baseline number ofpeople considered unsatisfactory. Clearly, there is no magic number. Current models of visi- tor management involve setting goals and objectives, for-mulating indicators and monitoring results. 6.1.3 Planning for visitor management should be based on the idea of limits to acceptable change.The new planning methodologies assume that all activitiescause impacts and that desired conditions should serve asthe baseline for planning. Managers need to know notonly how many people are in an area, but also how theseusers are affecting the areas natural and culturalresources. The new models set limits to impacts rather than visitation. It is a matter of tracking ecological andsocial indicators through field studies and user surveys. 6.1.4 The methodology known as Limits of Acceptable Change LAC sets standards and moni-toring indicators based on management and stake-holder concerns. When the quantifiable standards are not met, impacts have become so negative that the man-agement is prepared to take actions such as reducingaccess and restricting behaviours to avoid further degra-dation of resources, even if such actions would be unpop-ular. The idea is that environmental and social conditionswater and air pollution, litter, crowding and so on eachhave quantifiable standards based on desired conditions. When conditions approach limits of acceptable change, Carrying Capacity and Related Planning Issues6WH  manual1-ch6 311002 1500 Page 2 Carrying Capacity and Related Planning Issues 57management takes specific mitigating actions. LAC pro- grammes may set numeric visitor limits, for example 100people at a cultural site at any one time, but the overallprocess provides a much more comprehensive and effec-tive system for protecting resources. The challenge is todefine how much and what kind of change is accept-able and set indicator limits or standards for any changesthat would degrade the conditions agreed upon. LAC standards are established on the basis of stakeholder and management needs, and follow legal and Conventionguidelines. For instance, stakeholder concerns may centreon a desire to limit certain impacts by maintaining a clean,safe, uncrowded environment in a particular area of a nat-ural site. In this case, reliable indicators may include thenumber of people on a sites interpretive trail at any onetime, dangerous areas on the trail or the amount of litter. Management objectives should lead to measurable impact standards reflecting the desired conditions. Forexample, one site indicator may be the number of unsta-ble areas found on a tourist trail. In this case, the site man-ager should define what is meant by an unstable area andquantify the unstable areas along the trail. With this infor-mation, the manager, in consultation with an advisorygroup, can set a standard for keeping the area safe for vis-itors. If overcrowding is a concern, visitors can be regular-ly asked to report the number of fellow visitors seen onthe trail, producing data which can serve as an indicator.Other indicators may be social or economic, measuring forexample the revenue generated by a site and the responseof the local community to visitors. While the LAC methodology was the first of the new vis- itor management methodologies, all the newer planningmethodologies such as the Visitor Experience andResource Protection Process VERP are applicable to bothnatural and cultural sites and follow these basic steps 1.Determination of goals and objectives derived from the concerns of management and stakeholders and how toachieve them. 2.Formulation of a set of performance indicators based on the goals and objectives. 3.Monitoring to determine whether these standards are being met. 4.Deciding on actions to mitigate problems if the stan- dards are not met. 6.1.5 Tourism impact indicators should reflect stake- holder concerns, policy or vision statements, man-agement objectives and the needs of stakeholderswho are utilizing the information. These elements, combined with field experience, should inform meetingswith the advisory group aimed at selecting indicators totrack changes in the ecological, physical and social condi-tions. It is essential to inform those making decisions howthis information will be distributed. In general, it is notnecessary to monitor all indicators some overlap withothers and some may be simply too expensive or imprac-tical to monitor. Also, indicators should not be seen as a full measure of an impact or problem, but more anattempt to describe it. Not all problem areas and concernsare conducive to monitoring through indicators. Agreement on indicators is the single most important part of a monitoring and evaluation exercise. Experience hasshown that animated and collaborative brainstorming ses-sions are useful for identifying and agreeing on indicators. 6.1.6 An inventory of existing conditions provides the baseline data needed for indicators. Inventory information determines the degree to which existing con-ditions vary from desired conditions. Information on cur-rent conditions is the baseline for establishing realistic standards, a step needed for all the LAC-type methodolo-gies. So for example, if vandalism at a rock art site is anindicator, a count of all the graffiti found around the sitewill be necessary. Any inventory exercise should be carriedout according to established, written procedures, insuringconsistent monitoring practices over the long term. Aninventory will test the basic data collection techniques andprovide the information needed for a monitoring manual.This involves the development of standardised monitoringsurveys and evaluation forms, along with instructions formaking decisions on implementing actions to correctunacceptable conditions. Recommended Criteria for Indicators  Quantitative - The indicator can be measured quantitatively. Easily measurable - It can be measured by field per-sonnel using simple equipment and sampling techniques. Relevant to concerns - The indicator genuinely reflectsthe concern being tracked. Significant - It can detect a change in conditions thatwould disrupt the functioning of an ecosystem orreduce the future desirability of an area to visitors. Sensitive - The indicator allows easy detection ofchanges in conditions that occur within a year. Reliable over time - Monitoring of the indicator canbe carried out in the same way during each monitoringcycle. Responsive to management actions - The indicatorcan detect a change in conditions resulting from management actions. Cheap to measure - It does not require excessiveexpenditure on equipment or use of staff time. 6.1.7 Measurement standards for indicators provide targets for measuring tourism impacts to keep themwithin acceptable limits. The written descriptions of conditions favoured in a sites management objectives cangive direction to setting quantifiable standards. For exam-ple, a trail managed to offer a more natural type ofexprience may be maintained at a width of two metres,Carrying Capacity and Related Planning Issues 6WH  manual1-ch6 311002 1500 Page 3 58while a trail in an established tourist area having to accommodate larger groups may have a standard widthof three metres. Monitoring Indicators Some Examples  Abrasion of monuments  Status of vegetation Number of human encounters while travelling per day, bynumber of groups and their sizes Signs of pollution from humans, litter, food in streams Tourists complaints about conditions Number of disturbances to an archaeological site Erosion Disturbance of wildlife populations Graffiti or vandalism Complaints from community members on deterioratingcommunity values Increase in the number of crime reports Standards are usually set to prevent degradation of cur- rent conditions. An example would be a standard for maintaining the population of a particular bird species orwater quality. In some cases, however, even while man-agers would never desire degradation, they may set stan-dards permitting a deterioration of current conditions ifthey believe that this would be a lesser evil than, forinstance, having to restrict access or impose widelyunpopular rules. Meetings of the advisory group andorstakeholders will be needed to reach consensus on settingstandards. In large natural and mixed sites, the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum ROS system can be used to setstandards for different areas within the same site,depending on the needs of different user groups.Experience in the field indicates that users may hold awide range of opinions, and consequently managersshould consider setting wider ranges of standards. In nat-ural areas, priority should be assigned to users with thegreatest need for an unmodified environment. Once standards are set, an inventory will determine the degree to which existing conditions vary from desired con-ditions. For example, if a significant amount of an areastrails are found to be wider than the agreed standard, orif abrasions or damage to a monument exceed a particu-lar standard, actions can be taken to improve conditions.This is an ongoing process in which indicators are moni-tored on a regular basis to track trends and changes inconditions. 6.1.8 Misunderstandings persist among internation- al organisations and government agencies regard-ing carrying capacity. Calls continue for studies to provide policy-makers with a technical limit, a number orrange of numbers that will indicate negative change. Suchstudies can create the false impression that carryingcapacity can be reduced to a specific number indicating a clear point at which negative impacts will start to be seen.For example, at Lake Baikal, Russia, consultants wereasked to determine the number of visitors per hectare thatthe terrain around the lake could support. Figures werederived primarily from formulas involving soil impact andslope. The study also made predictions of cultural impactsbased on the number of tourists compared with the num-ber of local residents. While this methodology was easy toimplement within the allotted time for the project, it failedto take into account variations in tourist behaviour, travelpatterns and different stakeholder interests. Additionaldialogue with interest groups would have made thereports figures more relevant to the day-to-day work of site managers. More important, such dialogue wouldhave started a process for setting tourism goals and objec-tives among the stakeholders within the limits of legisla-tion on the environment and protected areas. 6.1.9 Managers may still feel the need to set numeric limits to control people at their sites. Visitor numbers should be set in accordance with agreed upon standards.In the field, this is not an exact science, but a matter oftracking impacts through monitoring programmes andarriving at an approximate judgement of when limits arereached. In practice, several strategies will help managers justify decisions to limit visitation. Data on numbers of vis-itors and their preferences make up the best justificationfor actions restraining the number of people permitted toenter an area. This is especially true if an expert study canbe shown to the stakeholders affected by the decision.Visitor surveys could demonstrate the negative effects of crowding and the desire for solitude at an archaeologicalor sacred site. The staff available to carry out protection efforts in rela- tion to the number of visitors can also be used to justifyrestrictions. For example, the number of tourists admitted to an archaeological site may be a function of the numberof guards available for patrolling the site to ensure its pro-tection. Numbers may be controlled simply by reducingthe size of a parking lot or visitor centre. However, such ameasure may detract from visitor satisfaction if it results incrowding. A Case Study A visitor management study was carried out using the Visitor Experience and Resource Protection Process VERP at the Petra archaeological site in Jordan. Developed bythe US National Park Service, VERP is a LAC-type systemthat does not necessarily set specific numbers as long asresources and social conditions can be measured andmaintained. To this end, a monitoring programme deter-mines whether desired conditions are being met. The fol-lowing table presents several of the indicators, standardsand methods of measurement recommended by the Carrying Capacity and Related Planning Issues6WH  manual1-ch6 311002 1500 Page 4 59team. In this plan some standards have been replaced by actions that would be implemented when an impact isidentified. 6.2 Monitoring issues 6.2.1 The shift to LAC-type methodologies has high- lighted the importance of monitoring. Managers need to know when desired conditions are being threatened,for example, with increasing water pollution in a streamor when waiting lines become too long at an entrance. Awell-developed and regular monitoring programme canprovide resource managers with data to justify sometimescontroversial actions such as limiting the number of peo-ple allowed into a site at a time. Monitoring visitors likes,dislikes and travel patterns, as well as their impacts, canhelp identify and justify needed actions in the changingtourist industry. 6.2.2 The most difficult aspect of monitoring is ensuring that it is carried out on a regular basis.Managers are faced with many pressing day-to-day prob-lems and often have little time or desire to carry out mon-itoring exercises. However, monitoring is effective only if it is done regularly if it cannot be sustained, its usefulnessis severely limited. well as their impacts, can help identifyand justify needed actions in the changing tourist industry. 6.2.3 Many types of monitoring procedures are pos- sible depending on the level of accuracy desired andavailable resources. For example, soil erosion on a nature trail can be measured in several ways. One methodis to identify eroded sections by walking the trail andcounting variations in width, perhaps caused when visi-tors seek to avoid muddy sections. Another is to establishpermanent checkpoints at problem areas along the trail tomeasure soil loss. Each approach has advantages and dis-advantages. Examining trail conditions in a general fash-ion does not give a precise measurement, but provides agood overview. On the other hand, while permanent mon-itoring plots will provide a more accurate measure of soilloss, the method is more expensive and time-consuming. The differences in approach can also be illustrated with bird population counts. One inexpensive method system-atically records the number of bird sightings by localguides. A more accurate but expensive method of track-ing population changes involves catching specimens withnets or setting up a transect, or a fixed corridor alongwhich species are counted on a regular basis. Fewer options exist for monitoring socio-economic condi- tions such as crowding and community attitudes. Mostsocio-economic information is obtained through ques-tionnaires or interviews, work that is labour-intensiveand time-consuming. A survey of community attitudestowards tourism, for example, takes large amounts oftime to develop, implement and analyse. A monitoringprocedure should be selected on the basis of what ques-tions need to be answered and how much time and fund-ing is available to carry out the work.At the Great BarrierReef in Australia, travel distances made monitoring eachcampsite in detail prohibitively expensive. Managersdecided instead on the more cost-effective tactic of sam-pling a cross-section of camping areas. Finally, all monitoring programmes should be evaluated to determine how well they measure the indicators. Thisevaluation should also determine how large a measuredchange must be for management to be confident that itis the result of visitor impact and not errors in data collection. 6.2.4 Monitoring of historic monuments must take into account values of integrity and authenticity.Indicators of structural or engineering conditions cannottranslate into an overview of the complete health of a sitesince they do not reflect values of integrity or authentici-ty. While it is important to monitor the use of a facility andvisitor satisfaction, experts say more monitoring is neededto measure the effectiveness of communicating a siteshistoric significance.

To implement thepolicy, decision makers spell out the reasons for a sitesnational significance before determining objectives andstandards for the purpose of monitoring. Making a state-ment of desired results and a list of those responsible isalso part of the process. Excerpts from a Monitoring Manual The following monitoring procedures from the US National Park Service for a nature trail point to the kindsof issues that could arise. Similar programmes could beadapted to other areas. As financial resources increase,more advanced monitoring procedures can be introduced,after an evaluation of the pros and cons, including thecosts of training staff in new procedures. For a newly opened trail, regular surveys can be conduct- ed to gauge visitors views regarding crowding and otherproblems. Questions can be modified according to cir-cumstances. General instructionsMeasure the distance from the beginning of a trail seg- ment to a given indicator. If possible, monitor the trailevery couple of months. Try to conduct the evaluationboth before and after the high tourist season.Record any necessary repairs or improvements, using thecomments section on the monitoring form to specifymaterials that will be needed and elaborate on problemareas. Specific instructions for sample indicatorsNote vegetation on the sides of the trails. The evaluator should note whether the vegetation is being maintainedat the agreed standard.Record any impacts to trees up to two metres from eachside of the trail. Impacts can include broken branches andcuts in trees due to human actions. Describe the impactsin the comments section.Wet soil sections are permanent areas more than two metres in length. These areas force visitors to walk on thesides of trails, increasing their width and causing erosion.The evaluator should measure and record the beginningand end of wet soil sections.Take note of any social trails -- unplanned secondary trails caused when visitors stray off the main trail or takea shortcut. These can cause erosion and destruction ofvegetation.Note any general problems outside the listed categories inthe comments section, for example, necessary repairs,dangerous areas and wildlife nesting areas.Indicate a permanent checkpoint for determining soil loss. Select points such as lookouts and those sensitive to visi-tor usage. Insert a wooden peg on each side of the trailso that an imaginary line connecting the two pegs crossesthe path. Measure the distance and note any prominentfeatures, for example, undisturbed vegetation, bareground and waterlogged soils. Ideally, these notes shouldbe supplemented with photographs.Collect all visible litter along the trail.Record any incidents of vandalism on trail infrastructure,signs or furniture such as benches or tables.Tally the number of trail encounters with other groups or individuals per visit. 6.2.5 Simple monitoring systems with built-in incen- tives may be the most feasible and best approachfor a sustainable programme. Given the many difficul- ties in sustaining a monitoring programme, considerationfor the practical needs of site managers, tourism officialsand private operators will improve chances of success.Monitoring can be incorporated into maintenance activi-ties, or local guides can carry out monitoring functions.Tour operators interested in tracking visitors preferences may be prepared to finance surveys. Government officialsmay also want the information because it can directlyaffect national tourism initiatives. Experience has shown that a simple monitoring pro- gramme is better than none at all and can be more effec-tive than costly ones. For example, with historic buildingsand other built cultural sites, a simple report with notesand photos has been found to be far more useful thandetailed, item-by-item reports on conditions. Short, simplereports covering general problems and a few specific problem areas allow staff to determine which propertiesrequire the most attention and to offer guidance to their agencies. Site staff are given a checklist of items to monitor. The monitor notes any changes made to the property sincethe last visit, any problems related to general maintenanceor repair, any potential problems, and any contemplatedchanges and repairs. Four categories are monitored exte-rior, interior, the area around the building and the rest ofthe grounds. General photographs are taken as well asmore specific problem areas. 6.3 Implications and recommendations  The determination of carrying capacity is most realisti-cally viewed as an ongoing process. LAC methodologiesgo far beyond the narrow purpose of setting a limit to thenumber of visitors to a site. The methodology should beused to determine range and conditions that manage-ment could treat as options for policy setting based onfeedback provided by monitoring programmes.  Management goals and objectives for controlling impacts caused by tourism must be supported by Carrying Capacity and Related Planning Issues6WH  manual1-ch6 311002 1500 Page 6 61quantifiable measures and other means of comparing cur- rent conditions against desired conditions. These should be the basis of a monitoring programme with well-defined indicators.  To identify monitoring indicators, planners should review stakeholder concerns, the sites policyvision state- ment and management objectives, then hold meetingswith the advisory group to agree on desired ecologicaland social conditions. Written management objectiveshelp give direction to the development of measurablestandards.  While managers will have the final decision, standards should be set on the basis of discussions with key stake-holders. Wherever possible, standards should not allow adowngrading of current conditions. For example, a stan-dard for maintaining the population of a particular birdspecies should not be set below current levels unless off-set by overwhelming advantages. Standards should be setwhenever possible to reflect ideal conditions.  Baseline data is essential to the establishment of realis- tic standards. An inventory will reveal the degree to whichexisting conditions vary from desired conditions.Standards must match goals and objectives and thedesired conditions of stakeholders. So for example, if localeducation is a management objective, a standard may beset after determining the number of school visits carriedout by staff during the past year.  Inventories should be conducted according to estab- lished and written procedures to insure consistent moni-toring over the long term. The procedures could provide abasic framework for a monitoring manual.  To ensure a monitoring programmes sustainability, indi- cators should be selected in accordance with practicalconsiderations. Local guides may be able to help withmonitoring, and private travel agencies interested intracking visitor preferences could finance surveys. Touroperators may be willing to invest in training for managersand contribute to monitoring.  An understanding of the causes of changes in indicators can point to management solutions. Problem analysisbegins with the monitoring process, during which solu-tions are identified to bring about desired conditions oreven surpass specified standards. Suggested Activities 1.Identify indicators  Review the list of impacts and their causes  Develop a preliminary list of tourism indicators withjustifications for their selection, and estimate associatedmonitoring costs Present the selected indicators to the advisory group for their review 2.Collect baseline data on the indicators selected  Develop a monitoring programme and write a moni- toring manual Train site staff in the agreed upon methods to collectthe data Determine how stakeholder partners could beinvolved in the monitoring 3.Set standards for indicators  Use the data from Step 2 to develop a preliminary set of indicator standards If ROS opportunity classes are being used, set stan-dards reflecting the different experiences desired in dif-ferent areas of the site In conjunction with the tourism advisory group, dis-cuss the proposed standards, reach consensus anddevelop a final agreement Suggested Reading Bennett, Gordon.

However, if eco-logical, physical andor social conditions approach orreach unacceptable levels, action must be taken. Knowledge of management strategies and solutionswill arm the manager with the options available forrestoring the desired conditions. Decision-making is also helped by an awareness of the consequencesassociated with these strategies and actions. 7.1 General issues 7.1.1 Any management action must begin with iden-tification of the likely causes of a defined problem.A decline in conditions is not necessarily caused bytourism. Coral may deteriorate naturally litter at anarchaeological site may be caused by locals, not tourists,and so on. Once the cause is clearly identified, correctiveactions can be taken. Well-focused actions, attacking thecause of the problem, save time and money. For example,an ongoing campaign may maintain an area affected bylitter, but it can be expensive and does not attack thecause of the problem. It may be more cost- effective toidentify the source of the litter and combine a mainte-nance programme with an education campaign thatattempts to affect peoples behaviour. 7.1.2 Management actions can be direct or indirect. Direct management actions confront problems of humanbehaviour through regulations that may entail enforce-ment, restricting activities or rationing use. Indirect meth-ods seek to affect behaviour through education,information and persuasion. Visitors can be informedabout the impacts connected with a certain activity, orgiven information that encourages the use of certainareas over threatened areas. Other indirect actions includephysical alterations, such as the redirection of a trail to amore resilient area of a forest, that influence the move-ment of visitors. In general, indirect actions are more successful in remote areas, where visitors freedom to explore is usually a pri-mary goal. Direct approaches are often used to prohibitvisitors from entering fragile or dangerous areas, forexample at an archaeological site where they might dam-age a priceless fresco. Experts say regulations succeedwhen they have strong public support, are carefullyexplained, and when visitors have some say in how theyare implemented. Visitors must understand why a behav-iour change is desirable. Once implemented, of course,regulations must be enforced. In practice, a combination of methods is generally used. For example, both direct and indirect actions can be usedto minimise visitors impact on a coral reef. Site staff candesign an extensive public information campaign that caninclude printed materials, direct advertising and schoolprogrammes. Tour operators can be managed through permits, regulations and enforcement actions aimed at concentrating recreation activities at resistant reefs. Acombination of methods is also recommended for con-trolling vandalism, including physical protection of theresource as well as education, making a site inaccessible to vehicles, increasing admission fees and protecting sitesby not promoting them. 7.1.3 Factors to consider when selecting manage- ment actions include whether they meet objectives,their likelihood of success and difficulties of imple-mentation, particularly cost. Management strategies should be in line with objectives. For example, if a man-agement objective at a Himalayan site is to offer visitorsthe freedom to explore, then a softer managementapproach may be appropriate. Here staff may wish toemphasise educating trekkers on low-impact expeditionbehaviour. On the other hand, if a sites objective is to pro-tect a priceless mosaic at an ancient monument, a moredirect approach may be appropriate such as the deploy-ment of guards to protect the site from looters or vandalsand to regulate tourism activity near the work of art. Actions should have a high probability of achieving the desired outcome. Before taking actions that may face resist-ance, it is important to ensure that norms and regulationsgive managers the legal mandate to act, and that appropri-ate enforcement systems will support its application. Awareness of the visitor profile helps to ensure success. For example, a large group of foreign visitors may bestrongly motivated towards the protection of an endan-gered species but unaware that they are disturbing theanimal during feeding times. In this case, educationalmaterials explaining low-impact viewing techniques maybe the best method for minimising impacts. Actions should be relatively easy and inexpensive to imple- ment. In general, direct methods are considered moretime-consuming and costly, while indirect actions arethought to be cheaper in the long run. 7.1.4 Experts suggest limiting regulation to the min- imum necessary to effectively accomplish manage-ment objectives. The most effective but least restrictive management actions should be implemented first. Theresults should be monitored, and more restrictive actions may be implemented if necessary until conditionsimprove. For example, to deal with uncontrolled dumpingof garbage, an educational campaign may be launcheddescribing the problem and inviting voluntary compliancewith a regulation against dumping at the site. If voluntarymethods fail, a fine can be imposed. If this doesnt work,the area may have to be closed. At some sites, human and financial resource limitations may necessitate more direct approaches in the short term.Experts in both the North and the South stress the needto develop visitor education programmes and other indi-rect methods. However, managers often opt for direct Strategies and Solutions to Tourism Management Problems7WH  manual1-ch7 311002 1503 Page 2 65methods when faced with problems such as proximity to high population centres and limited staff and finances. Inthese situations, the cost and time involved in implement-ing indirect methods is weighed against immediate prob-lems, such as the need to prevent the rapid degradationof an archaeological site by visitors buying objects stolenfrom the site. 7.2 Reducing the number of people who enter an area Reducing visitation in high use areas is a justifiable means of avoiding social impacts such as crowding, butmay not by itself substantially reduce some ecologicalimpacts. Reducing the number of people in an area caneffectively reduce crowding or congestion, for example ata historical monument. However, since some environmen-tal impacts follow the curvilinear trend discussed inChapter 3, in natural areas such measures may not solveenvironmental problems unless visitors are also directed tomore resistant areas. An Overview of Management Strategies Management strategies affecting the level and nature of exploitation of a site and its physical and socio-economicenvironment seek to minimise or reduce the impact ofeach visitor. Factors, or variables that can be affected orcontrolled, include the number of visitors, the types ofactivity, visitors behaviour and the environments physicaland social resistance and resilience. A number of strate-gies address these variables Visitor levels may be controlled by reducing the total number of people allowed at a site or reducing the num-ber of people allowed in one or several areas of a site bydispersing them or by concentrating them in a specificarea. Types of activities can be changed or influenced by addressing the ways in which the activity is practised,offering incentives for people to practise particular activi-ties or imposing direct actions to restrict certain activities. A sites physical environment may be altered to make it more resistant to impacts through the use of infrastructure. A sites social environment can be affected by reducing conflicts between visitors and between visitors and thelocal community. Management options for reducing the number of visitors to a site can include  restricting entry or closing an area  limiting group sizes implementing a quota or permit system increasing fees or not providing facilities.Options for dispersing or concentrating people to reduce use in a particular area can include  restricting the number of people who can enter the threatened area  limiting the permissible length of stay in the threat- ened area  raising the entrance fee for the threatened area only not providing facilities in the threatened area zoning an area for a particular activity and not per- mitting the activity in the threatened area  directing tourists to more resilient areas through zon- ing, visitor education and offering more facilities orfewer facilities  charging different entrance fees on certain days of the week and  using a promotion and interpretation campaign to influence the use of one area over another. Visitors behaviour can be changed through  education programmes teaching low-impact ways to visit a site, e.g., techniques for observing wildlifewithout disturbing it  interpretation programmes teaching respect for a sites resources and protection issues. Site managers may encourage visitors to practise particular activities by  raising or lowering prices for certain types of visitors  restricting opening hours, e.g. opening a site early for bird-watchers or closing it early to discourage otherclientele  offering or not offering infrastructure prohibiting certain activities through regulation and enforcement. A sites physical environment can be made more resistant to impacts by  using infrastructure to harden a site, e.g., harden- ing a trail with a wooden boardwalk or installing per-manent moorings  relocating infrastructure to more resilient areas, e.g., moving a mountain refuge to an area less prone toerosion. Actions for reducing conflicts between visitors include  zoning an area for compatible activities  influencing the types of tourism activities practised at a site by providing or not providing facilities.Strategies and Solutions to Tourism Management Problems 7WH  manual1-ch7 311002 1503 Page 3 66Options for reducing conflict between local people and the communities include  channelling economic benefits to local populations  incorporating socio-cultural values into the sites man- agement planning and development by increasing community participation. Also, where light use causes considerable environmental damage, decreases in traffic in the area may not have cor-respondingly positive effects. In such cases reducing visi- tor traffic may do little to boost recovery rates for soil andvegetation and an area may need to be closed for recov-ery to occur. On sites that have already suffered degradation to vege- tation, practically all use may have to be curtailed beforerecovery can occur. Impacts to water and wildlife resources are more varied and in some cases can respond to a reduction in use levels. For example, bears in theYellowstone National Park World Heritage site pose a greater problem in high-use areas, and reducing visitationmay reduce incidents between bears and campers. 7.2.1 In some areas, even if limits are imposed, meas- ures to concentrate and control visitors are neededto reduce ecological impacts. People have a tendency to go to the same places and follow the same routes.However, once people arrive at an established site such asa camping ground, they tend to disperse within the limitsof the camping area. Limiting use -- for example by reduc-ing the number of campsites around a lake -- wouldreduce the number of visitors but not necessarily reduce their ecological impact as they spread out over all thecampsites. Actions would be needed to both reduce thenumber of people and ensure the permanent closing ofselected campsites. On the other hand, in lightly usedareas, visitor reductions can minimise ecological impactsas long as use levels are kept low, visitors are instructed inlow-impact techniques and they avoid fragile areas. Evenone uneducated party of visitors can inflict serious damage. 7.2.2 Limiting the length of stay at a site can reduce numbers and alleviate crowding problems but maynot necessarily reduce environmental impacts. Limits can be placed on time spent anywhere at the site or atspecific areas, a measure that helps reduce crowding.Length-of-stay limits at heavily used natural areas areunlikely to have any effect on ecological impacts unlessthe limits are very restrictive and targeted to reduce meas-urable indicators. Ecological impacts are best reduced byimposing length-of-stay limits in lightly used areas infragile areas, a long stay in any one place could causeunacceptable impacts.7.2.3 Closing an area can be an effective way to pro- tect or restore environmental quality. The measure encourages the recovery of vegetation and reduceswildlife impacts. For example, visitors to Big Bend NationalPark in Texas, USA, are excluded during the breeding season of peregrine falcons to protect their nesting sites.Closure of an area, however, is a direct action that can becontroversial and have economic and social ramifications.Any closure should be explained to the local community,not just to would-be visitors. 7.2.4 Reducing numbers by limiting the size of par- ties can also help control ecological and socialimpacts. Large parties can cause overcrowding as well as visitor conflicts. In more popular areas, limits on party sizeand an educational campaign may be needed to reduceimpacts and to ensure more privacy for each group of vis-itors. In such cases educational programmes should stressthe importance of using existing areas and keeping thempleasant for the next visitors. Big groups are likely to create wider disturbed areas than smaller groups because they tend to spread out over alarger area. They can also disturb an area more rapidlythan a small party. However in an area that is alreadyheavily affected, it makes little difference if a group size is10 or 50. 7.2.5 Quotas can be used to reduce visitor levels but raise several issues. A point to consider is the finan-cial cost of implementing and administering thequota system. If staffing is insufficient, a quota system probably cannot be maintained over the long term. Also,quotas favour people who can book in advance, exclud-ing other categories of potential visitors. Any sort of limitation may annoy visitors who cherish their freedom. Quota systems may especially irk those whoconsider themselves traditional users of a site. As a resultthey may choose to go elsewhere, and other sites may notbe able to cope with increased use. Thus, for a quota sys-tem to be successful, access should be limited to alterna-tive sites and user groups need to understand and acceptthe rationing technique being implemented. 7.2.6 Increasing visitor fees and other charges can reduce visitor numbers. The laws of supply and demand dictate that higher fees at a site will reduce visitation. Afactor to consider when raising fees is the elasticity ofdemand, or how sensitive visitors are to a change in thecost of entering an area. This information can be gleanedfrom surveys. Another factor to consider is that visitorswant pricing schemes to be easy and straightforward.They tend to prefer an all-inclusive fee over a main feeplus separate charges such as for parking or taking pho-tographs. Setting visitor fees may also involve setting dif-ferent entrance fees for local people and foreigners. Strategies and Solutions to Tourism Management Problems7WH  manual1-ch7 311002 1503 Page 4 67Reducing Demand with Higher Visitor Fees Higher entrance fees can lower demand, reducing the number of visitors, without necessarily reducing overallrevenue. An increase in the park entry fee at KeoladeoNational Park in India, for example, resulted in an 11 percent decrease in tourism down from 126,539 in 1996-97to 113,004 in 1997- 98. Overall, revenue more thandoubled over the period with the number of foreigntourists climbing by four percent, from 40,894 in 1996-97to 42,532 in 1997-1998. 7.2.7 Not providing facilities can reduce visitor num- bers. Limiting infrastructure such as camping areas or parking spaces can reduce visitor numbers just as addinginfrastructure can increase numbers. Simply makingaccess more difficult, for instance, by locating parking far-ther away from entrances, can also slow visitation. InCosta Rica, community pressure to limit tourism at aReserve put a stop to a plan to pave the access road to thecommunity and the reserve. On the other hand, increas-ing infrastructure such as adding signs and informationalplaques can increase the popularity of a site and itsresources, for example, an underwater shipwreck. This strategy raises several issues including safety con- cerns. At a rain forest park, for example, managementmay want to provide a system of signs, boardwalks andbridges to direct visitors safely back to the entrance ratherthan run the risk of having to carry out expensive search-and-rescue operations. The elasticity of demand related to infrastructure develop- ment may vary from one site to another. Many WorldHeritage sites, because they are unique, can attract signif-icant numbers of people even if infrastructure develop-ment is limited. For example, Mount Everest wouldprobably continue to attract substantial numbers of expe-ditions with or without infrastructure and facilities. TheInca archaeological site at Machu Picchu would continueto attract large numbers of tourists without the additionof a cable car. This type of policy requires managers to keep a record of visitor demand to track changes with different levels ofinfrastructure. Even more important are on-site interviewswith tourists and tour operators to help staff to determinethe effects of infrastructure policy. By maintaining ongo-ing dialogue with stakeholders such as tour operatorswho are members of the sites tourism advisory board andwho have an intimate knowledge of visitor preferencesand movements, site managers can obtain practical adviceon the effects of these policies. 7.3 Weighing whether to disperse or con- centrate visitors 7.3.1 Concentrating people can limit social and envi- ronmental impacts. The strategy offers a high level ofcontrol and protection for sensitive resources. By limiting use to a few selected areas within a site, particularly areasthat are resistant to impacts or at least not as sensitive toimpacts, the policy confines disturbance to a smaller area.So at sites with sensitive resources, a concentration strat-egy can be used to direct visitors to areas where resourcesare more resilient and resistant. For example, some coralsare more resistant to impacts than others, so visitors maybe concentrated at more resistant areas. At Stonehenge,except for certain religious groups who are free to enterat certain times, visitors are not permitted to cross thesites outer perimeter. Besides limiting impacts to certain areas, concentrating use may open up new opportunities. For example, thepolicy may provide a rare opportunity to experience anarea in relative isolation, perhaps at an archaeological site.The chance to be part of a small group visiting an isolat-ed, highly protected site may be unique, and one thatpeople may also be willing to pay more for. A policy of concentrating may help avert possible impacts on naturally fragile areas resulting from the tendency oftourism enterprises such as hotel chains and theme parksto grow and expand. In sites that are already heavilyimpacted, there may be no other alternative but toencourage or restrict visitors to existing use patterns.Since people tend to use the same areas and the sameroutes, implementing this measure is usually not difficult and can be accomplished through regulation or throughindirect methods such as persuading visitors to use a cer-tain area or providing infrastructure in specific areas. Concentrating tourists may produce a positive social out- come by allowing local people to escape the pressuresassociated with tourism. For example, in community ruralvillage encampments developed for tourists in Senegal,tourist accommodations are situated well away from thevillage centre. In Ujung Kulon National Park in West Javain Indonesia, tourism activities are restricted to a zone thatis managed by a private company that provides accom-modation and services. A possible disadvantage of concentrating use is that it changes the social climate of an environment for the visi-tors. At many sites, when tourists are clustered together,for example in an enclave of small hotels, they lose thefeeling of solitude. This may be contrary to the visitorexperience that was originally planned andor what origi-nally attracted people to the site. 7.3.2 Dispersing visitors is seldom simple and may not mitigate impacts. Limiting environmental impacts in natural areas by dispersing use to different areas can beeffective in areas where use levels are low and visitors areconscientious about their behaviour. A dispersal policyshould be supported with programmes designed to con-trol where people go and how they engage in recreation-al activities. The policy may not be feasible at natural siteswith limited resources for educating or controlling visitors.Strategies and Solutions to Tourism Management Problems 7WH  manual1-ch7 311002 1503 Page 5 68In addition, careful monitoring of a dispersal programme is needed because of the high potential for spreadingproblems. Dispersing visitors by extending the tourist season is an option that may have ecological consequences. For exam-ple, using quotas and visitor permits can reduce crowdingbut may concentrate use in a season during which vege-tation and wildlife are more fragile. Wildlife is especiallyvulnerable during the reproductive months and when ani-mals feed for winter. During periods of higher rainfall andsnowmelt, the ground may be more susceptible to com-paction and breaking. Plants are more vulnerable duringgrowth seasons. At cultural sites, such as monuments with well-developed and protective infrastructure where there is little risk ofenvironmental impacts, dispersing visitors is an effectiveway to relieve crowding. Dispersing visitors to differentareas of a site can be accomplished through regulations orthrough information and persuasion. It can also beaccomplished through the strategic placement of infra-structure. If staffing levels allow, direct actions such asissuing permits may also be effective. A permit systemincreases the distance between parties and supports amanagement objective of providing an experience inwhich human encounters are infrequent. 7.3.3 The decision to concentrate or disperse tourism should reflect policy goals and management objectives. A frequent policy goal is to assure that the benefits of tourism flow to the communities around a site.This may lead to pressure to open up new areas of a siteto visitors. Tourism has a tendency to spread, and can leadin turn to the spread of social and ecological impacts. If onthe other hand local economic development is a key goal,and there is sufficient revenue-generating potential toreplace current economic activities in a given area, then expanding tourism to the area may be appropriate. But if the main policy goal is protection of an endangered species and promoting visits by biologists, expandingtourism within a park may limit opportunities for researchbecause of increased tourism impacts in sensitive areas. 7.4 Changing the physical environment to resist impacts 7.4.1 Increasing a sites resistance to visitor impacts by installing or modifying infrastructure is generallyreferred to as site-hardening. Adding infrastructure, or hardening a site, strengthens its physical durability. Thismay involve surfacing access routes and trails, or buildingshelters for trekkers, or barriers to prevent people fromtouching priceless mosaics such as at the Taj Mahal. Anexample of extensive hardening of a cultural site is at theGreat Temple of Abu Simbel, in Egypt, where the dailyinflux of 2,000 tourists was causing traffic jams. Inside thetemple, their respiration increased the humidity and car-bon dioxide in the air, causing salt deposits to form on thewalls. To address the traffic problems, management implemented a one-way road system. A ventilation systemwas installed to reduce the humidity and the temperaturein the burial chamber. Another way to avoid impacts issimply to move infrastructure away from sensitive areas. 7.4.2 Hardening has both costs and benefits because it changes the nature of the visitors experience.Hardening can lead to a change in visitor profile. TheMilford track in New Zealand and the Overland track inTasmania, both popular backpacking routes, saw an increase in use during the 1980s. Management respond-ed to the resulting impacts by rationing use and harden-ing the tracks surfaces. Consequently, some visitorsconsidered the tracks too easy and stopped using them. Making experiences easier by hardening a site can also increase the level of crowding. In Tasmania, a boardwalkwas built to restrict access to parts of the Gorden River.For business reasons, tour group sizes were not reduced,and groups could number more than 50. Crowding ontothe boardwalk, the visitors had difficulty photographingone of the sites star attractions, a famous 2,000-year-oldHuon pine tree. Another effect of site hardening is that added materials may not blend in with the surrounding environment,compromising the original values of the site. One solutionis to use natural materials instead of intrusive man-madematerials. For example, fast-growing plants can be usedto block a trail leading to a fragile or restricted area, or anentrance may be filled in with natural debris and rocks. 7.5 Changing visitor behaviour 7.5.1 Interpretation and education programmes can mitigate environmental and social impacts.Educational programmes instruct people on how best tobehave at a site. Interpretation programmes inform andexplain the sites resources and significance to the visitor. Visitors can be taught low-impact techniques at both cul- tural and natural sites. In the United States, a Save theManatee Campaign involved distributing guidelines totourists and resulted in a decline in manatee mortality andinjury. At the Luxor site, in Egypt, authorities reported thatby explaining management problems to visitors they suc-ceeded in distributing visitor movements more evenly.Interpretation and education programmes, although theymay take time to succeed, may be preferable to infra-structure development because they are less likely tochange the visitor experience and displace original targetgroups. Certain impacts can be almost eliminated by teaching vis- itors minimum-impact techniques. In Tasmania, on theOverland track in the Cradle Mountain-Lake St. ClairNational Park, trekkers came down with gastroenteritisbecause they were burying their waste too close to camp-ing huts, contaminating water and food supplies. At oneStrategies and Solutions to Tourism Management Problems7WH  manual1-ch7 311002 1503 Page 6 69point up to half of the users were reporting falling ill. To correct the situation, park management mailed materialsto walking clubs, environmental groups and campingstores outlining the problem and the solution that walkersbury their waste at least 100 metres from huts, campsitesand streams. The following summer, only eight to 10 per-cent of the users reported contracting gastroenteritis.Similar results have been achieved with education cam-paigns promoting low-impact wildlife viewing and otherecologically sound practices such as using stoves insteadof fires, packing out garbage and not feeding animals.Most experts in the protection of monuments also advo-cate visitor education as part of the strategy for combat-ting problems such as vandalism. 7.5.2 Interpretation and education campaigns need not be overly costly. Goals should be critically evaluated to determine whether they could be met just as effective-ly through modest means. Instead of allocating hugesums to large infrastructure projects such as sophisticatedvisitor centres, cheaper approaches may be more effec-tive, for example, a programme involving personal contactbetween visitors and management staff. In some situa-tions a team could travel from site to site to update andimprove interpretation facilities and materials, and to trainlocal managers and rangers. Educational and interpreta-tion campaigns are possible at minimal expense. Forexample on a short nature walk, small signs giving thecommon and scientific names of the flora can suffice,while larger signs can be made on more general themes. 7.5.3 Changing visitor behaviour is not a simple process. Interpretation and education campaigns stem from a desire to change visitor behaviour, a simple princi-ple in theory but complex in practice. Many factors havebeen found to influence visitor behaviour, including thefollowing Visitors want to know why they should do something. A simple statement that an area is a low-use area does notprovide enough information. The interpretation programme must match the current reality, or confusion will result. For example, photographs and descriptions in promotional publications may not cor-respond to the visitor experience. A case in point was when the Tasmanian Forestry Commission, in educationaland promotional materials, emphasised the recreationalattractions of its forests. Feedback from visitors revealedthat they had not expected to be able to see clearcuttingfrom trails and picnic areas. One solution was to includeimages of forest production activities in the promotionalliterature. The behaviour of staff including maintenance personnel must uphold the values reflected in educational and inter-pretation materials. A visitors experience and prior knowledge may influence the effectiveness of educational materials. Research hasindicated that educational materials are more effective for visitors with limited experience of a site or advance information about it. Special care must be taken with the content and delivery of interpretation materials for repeatvisitors. Experts recommend that if two versions of thematerials are not feasible it may be better to ignore themore experienced audience. Visitors must believe that a given issue is real and serious, that a given action is necessary, and that they can make adifference. Materials should present an issue along withinformation on how to address it, linking visitors experi-ence with future actions. The materials could includeinformation on environmentalists clubs, other places tovisit and learn about a subject, or other additional infor-mation. A person has to believe that he or she is capable of con- tributing to a solution, such as by planting a seedling in areforestation project or helping out at an archaeological dig. Individual rewards can be financial but psychicrewards the gratification deriving from altruistic motives are often more meaningful. 7.5.4 Several other factors figure in the effective presentation of interpretation and educational pro-grammes. Clear goals and objectives are needed to determine what is to be interpreted, for whom and how,and who will develop interpretation strategies. The crucialstep of identifying fundamental messages and targetaudiences is reportedly the weakest link in the process ofdeveloping interpretation concepts and themes. Materials should focus on the type of visitor whose behav- iour is considered most in need of change. The messageshould clearly describe the critical problems and recom-mended behaviours. The most effective educational campaigns use a combina- tion of methods tailored for particular user groups andmessages. They are based on specific visitor profiles cata-loguing age, background, interests, origin foreign orlocal, degree of skill in the activities the site offers, specialneeds, form of access to the site road or waterway, pub-lic or private. Profiles also take into account whether vis-itors are on their own, in couples or families, or part of anorganised group. Interpretation criteria may change with societal changes such as shifts in ethnicity or local education levels. Suchshifts may necessitate new messages, perhaps in differentlanguages. An exhibit should satisfy the expectations ofoccasional tourists as well as those of local residents andrepeat visitors. Layered signs offer detailed information in smaller print intended to pique the interest of repeatvisitors. Studies show the need for careful analysis of visitor inter- ests. Many people visit World Heritage sites out of a gen-eral interest in heritage. Most visitors to World HeritageStrategies and Solutions to Tourism Management Problems 7WH  manual1-ch7 311002 1503 Page 7 70sites have little specialist knowledge or interest the particulars of a castle or other historical site are of sec-ondary importance. Interpretative programmes should be evaluated in terms of whether they are meeting management goals andobjectives. If not, they are a poor investment of scarceresources, at the expense of other programmes and the managements reputation. Experts warn against a tenden-cy to produce new programmes rather than re-examineexisting ones, leaving no arguments in favour of one orthe other. The easiest and most common way to evaluate the effec- tiveness of an interpretation programme such as an exhib-it is to assess its ability to attract and hold visitorsattention. In this case an exhibit is judged on how manypeople stop and how much time they spend lookingandor reading the exhibit material. Staff intuition con-cerning attitude change is generally reliable and can con-tribute to assessment studies. The target audience may be reached in various ways, depending on the type of materials used. In general, visi-tors who must rely on public transport or a service pro-vided by the site management for access to an area is acaptive audience. Staff can inform visitors of park regula-tions and provide safety advice and orientation pointers. To encourage return visits, exhibits should be changed regularly, or special exhibitions should be staged on occa- sion. The Royal British Columbia Museum in Vancouversaw a decline in annual visitation because the exhibitsremained unchanged through lack of funds. Revenues declined as a result, compounding the problem. Guides can be invaluable in imparting educational infor- mation to visitors. In large tropical rain forests, for exam-ple, tourists unaccompanied by an excellent guide mayspend long periods without seeing any wildlife. Eighty to95 percent of travellers to rain forest lodges in one regionof Peru reported being unsatisfied with wildlife viewing. Involving guides in the planning stages when developing educational and interpretation programmes helps toensure consistency in visitor information. Guides and sitestaff should liaise closely so that guides do not competewith the aims of the site, and so that their information iscorrect and consistent. 7.5.5 Methods of presentation vary in their ability to attract visitors and change behaviour. The following materials have been found to be effective The Tasmania Parks Department found that the most effective presentation materials were fun as well as easyand quick to read. Videos were the most popular and themost effective. Because videos bring information to lifeand show how techniques work in practice, they are pop-ular for use in schools and with inexperienced groups. Comic posters, audio-visual materials and multimedia pre- sentations have also proven effective. Once materials raise visitors attention, the most effective method for changing behaviours is to add personal con-tact. For example, walkers are more readily convinced notto use stoves when rangers inform them face to faceabout regulations, reinforcing a strong educational cam-paign. Simply erecting signs saying fuel stoves only isfar less effective. In the absence of rangers, guides can be trained to pres- ent interpretation information. Workshops for commercialtour guides could cover low-impact techniques and othermanagement issues. Local guides at Nan Madol, a SouthPacific island with an important archaeological site, arecrucial in educating tourists and controlling graffiti andother forms of vandalism. Interactive interpretive programmes show great promise. Participatory exhibits are more popular than static displaysand are highly effective in changing visitor behaviour.Active participation seems to foster a positive attitude,especially when combined with a rewarding experience.Interactive techniques giving opportunities for feedbackinclude despatching roving staff or placing them at fixedpoints to provide information holding conferences or dis-cussions offering entertainment events such as puppetshows, plays or musicals, or organising activities such asmaking and measuring things, games and re-enactmentsof historical events. Publications, signs, self-guided activi-ties, visitor centres, audio-visual devices, indoor and out-door exhibitions such as walks, drives and snorkellingtrails in marine parks are less interactive -- but less time-consuming for staff. Hands-on workshops may be coupled with field trips and observational tours. One scientist-teacher from PuertoRico recommended that coastal ecosystems are bestunderstood through field trips during which participantscan question and interact with the expert. The TropenMuseum in Amsterdam offers a programme in which peo-ple can seek advice from experienced travellers about cur-rent events in a particular country and various cultural dos and donts. Authentic displays based on economic activities using real artefacts and materials are increasingly popular. At theNational Fishing Centre in Grimsby, England, for example,former trawler hands recount their experiences to thepublic and encourage participation by instructing visitorsin knotting fishing line. Heritage centres increasingly offerauthentic experiences through imaginative interpretationsof local history. Since the 1980s, old established muse-ums, thanks to new technologies, have been offeringentertainment as well as education, blurring the distinc-tion between the theme park and museum experience. Oral history is a particularly useful research asset and an important source of interpretative material. The processStrategies and Solutions to Tourism Management Problems7WH  manual1-ch7 311002 1503 Page 8 71gets local people involved and makes them feel repre- sented, which may be especially important if it turns outthat the local interpretation is at variance with that of sitematerials. Including the voices of local people in interpre-tative programmes gives them a central role, encouragingpopular support. 7.6 Offering incentives for practising certain activities 7.6.1 Visitors may be redirected through scheduling. For example, a site may be opened early for bird-watchersor closed early to limit other types of visitors. TheMonteverde Cloud Forest Reserve in Costa Rica opensearly so that bird-watchers can enjoy their activity in rela-tive calm. Extending a sites opening hours may dependon whether resources are sufficient to pay staff for theextra time. The extra expense could be offset throughhigher visitor fees or increased publicity. 7.6.2 Providing or not providing infrastructure for certain activities can influence the type of activitypractised. Strategic construction and siting of infrastruc- ture can encourage the use of certain areas over others.Signs can promote one site over another, while removingsigns can discourage use. In areas where there may beconflict between different user groups or where separat-ing the groups could enhance the visitor experience, low-cost infrastructure development could encourageseparation. For example, signs could direct campers awayfrom areas used by day visitors. 7.7 Changing types of activity through regulation 7.7.1 Regulations limiting activities andor the way they are practised can radically affect ecological andsocial impacts. Some recreation activities producemore impacts than others. The types of visitor activities can be limited. For example, banning off-road vehiclesand motorcycles reduces soil erosion, as does the use ofhorses. To limit traffic and pollution problems, Bermudahas adopted a policy of not recognising foreign driverslicences, making car rental impossible. Similarly, non-resi-dent cars have been banned on the Italian islands ofCapri, Ischia and Procida. To minimise negative impacts due to encounters between tourists and whales at Glacier Bay, Alaska, authoritieshave set limits on the number of cruise ships entering thebay and issued regulations for maintaining a minimumdistance of 400 metres between ships and whales. Whale-watching regulations are also in place for local guides atViscaino Bay in Baja, California. Once again, such regulatory measures require sufficient resources to implement. Complementary indirect actions can provide support to direct actions. For example, at some game parks in Africa, drivers often fail to observeregulations for maintaining acceptable distances from thewildlife. To address this problem, culverts can be dug alongside roads to prevent vehicles from leaving them. 7.8 Changing the sites social environment by reducing visitor conflicts 7.8.1 Separating conflicting activities reduces con- flict. Allocating specific activities to certain areas helps reduce conflict between different types of visitors. For example, groups such as snorkellers and sports fishermenwould conflict if they tried to use the same areas. Theconcept of separating user groups is related to theRecreational Opportunity Spectrum. A key issue whenusing this technique is to ensure that the different areasfor different activities remain in good environmental con-dition for the long term. Visitors and tour operators couldbe informed that if an area allocated to them is damaged,they wont be offered an alternative area. 7.8.2 Developing interpretation and education pro- grammes in close cooperation with the communitycan help to avoid alienating local people who mayotherwise feel their cultural identity is being mis-represented. The feeling of sense of place and the strong spirituality and identity which traditional people have fortheir land is not easily conveyed to visitors. For the localcommunity, memory, attachment and symbolism areoften of primary importance. In contrast, visitors mayseem to diminish local values by being attracted to theunfamiliar, exotic and picturesque. Interpretation and edu-cation programmes, when developed in close cooperationwith the community, can help prevent a devaluation oftraditional local values. 7.9 Distributing benefits to communities affected by the site 7.9.1 Locals are more likely to participate in conser- vation when it is associated with an improvement intheir standard of living. Managers at Ujung Kulon National Park in West Java in Indonesia report that localincome-generating activities in tourism, resource manage-ment and protection encourage local support for parkprotection and conservation efforts. Environmental con-servation and education programmes alone will notachieve results. In Gambia, West Africa, the local commu-nitys acceptance of the new Kiang West National Parkwas based entirely on the expectation that they wouldreceive a portion of the economic benefits of tourism. However, increasing local benefits -- for example, by pro- viding training for local guides -- does not necessarilydraw people into conservation and protection activities.Experience has shown that conservation and economicdevelopment should be linked. Thus guides should berecruited who have an ongoing interest in conservation or community participation. Evaluations of local guide train-ing in Costa Rica indicated a need for a comprehensiveselection process, in search of both talent and environ-mental and community consciousness.Strategies and Solutions to Tourism Management Problems 7WH  manual1-ch7 311002 1503 Page 9 727.9.2 Experience has determined that community tourism projects are sustainable when people investtheir labour and savings in them. Projects succeed when people have a stake in them. When people can seethe projects benefits they willingly contribute their labouror money. In Nepals Annapurna Conservation AreaProject, people are expected to contribute cash or labourto community development projects. Lodge owners whoupgrade their facilities are provided with technical assis-tance and training including help in the development oftheir standards. 7.9.3 Community tourism programmes may be more effective if introduced gradually and in conjunctionwith other economic development programmes.Gradual introduction is recommended in view of potentialnegative social and economic impacts. Communities mayneed time to adapt to the realities of the industry, to man-age problems stemming from the influx of visitors, and toplan efficient ways to capture and retain economic bene-fits from tourism. A communitys expectations of economic benefits are often disappointed because of inadequate local condi-tions. For example, foreign tourists may demand stan-dards of accommodations and food beyond what thelocal community can immediately provide. Thus, localsmay not begin to see direct economic benefits until cer-tain basic problems are addressed. Gradual implementa-tion can exacerbate the problem, as people becomeimpatient for the economic benefits. Such problems may be mitigated when other income- generating programmes are carried out concurrently andthe community is not oriented solely towards tourism. Forexample, many projects at protected areas include agro-forestry and other resource development programmesthat can produce economic benefits such as crops andwood lots for firewood. Such options can lessen the needfor more rapid tourism development. 7.9.4 Tourisms potential for benefiting locals is a function of the existing resources and skills that canbe used to generate income. Community tourism pro- grammes should start with an evaluation of localresources and skills with which activities can be matched. For example, in many instances local transportation sup-port is needed for tourism activities, or local knowledge isin demand because of difficult terrain, such as atCorcovado National Park in Costa Rica, where groundtransportation to the park is difficult, and flying is moreexpensive. Other activities that may need local guidingand transportation skills include mountaineering,trekking, sport fishing, skin diving, and horseback riding.More specialised activities such as bird-watching and riverrafting usually require more education and training.Opportunities for these activities often depend on theexistence of government or NGO training programmes,and tour operators who are interested in involving localpeople.Directing Benefits to Local People Through Employment Opportunities When Indias Keoladeo bird sanctuary became a national park, new regulations prohibited wood collecting andgrazing, severely affecting local people who depended onthe parks natural resources for their livelihood. To offsetsome of these impacts, tourism is being encouraged as analternative source of income. Keoladeo, located withinthe Golden Triangle tourist route joining New Delhi,Agra and Jaipur, is one of Asias most popular naturalsites, with 125,000 visitors per year, 70 percent fromwithin India. With its large population of migratory and resident birds including Siberian cranes, Keoladeo is on the list of attrac-tions of many specialised tour operators. To take advan-tage of the tourism opportunities, the parks deputy chiefwarden has devised a creative strategy to generate localbenefits. Transportation and interpretation are providedby 108 rickshaw drivers and 98 naturalist guides. Motor-less boats are also maintained and driven by a permanentstaff recruited from adjoining areas, providing anotherlocal employment option. In addition, 60 percent of thepark staff is drawn from villages adjoining the protectedarea. The park advertises for rickshaw drivers in the localnewspaper. Drivers are given three months of training inthe parks natural and cultural history as well as that ofthe local communities and tourist areas. Authorised rick-shaws bear a yellow metal permit. They are allowed towork both inside and outside the park area. A lottery sys-tem of rotating turns is used to avoid arguments betweenthe drivers taking tourists into the park. Local guides are also trained in natural history, interpreta- tive skills, visitor management and languages. Guidelicences are renewed every July after the successful com-pletion of a refresher course. Recent years have seen ashift to recruiting from unemployed low-income groups,particularly young people from rural areas. About one-third of the guides are from the surrounding communi-ties. Initially guides were required to be English-speakingschool graduates, but Hindi-speaking guides have beenaccepted given that 70 percent of the visitors are domes-tic tourists. Seasonal financial problemsAlthough daily revenues for rickshaw drivers can be sub- stantial during the peak season at Keoladeo, when visita-tion drops in line with birds migratory patterns only afew of the drivers can continue to work. While manyhave work in the area during the low season, some arehired to remove water hyacinth a weed from the parkswetland areas.Strategies and Solutions to Tourism Management Problems7WH  manual1-ch7 311002 1503 Page 10 73An eco-surcharge Tour operators and tourists can make direct contributions to Keoladeo park and its development schemes. Seventy-five percent of the fees and donations go to a specialproject fund administered by the Keoladeo National ParkDevelopment Society grouping park authorities, districtadministration and village community representatives,local NGOs and representatives from the agriculture, animal husbandry, education, irrigation, tourism, and waterworks departments. The success of the scheme dependson transparency, with the different players having well-defined roles. 7.9.5 Labour costs should be realistically evaluated when analysing community potential. If little or no cap- ital is required to develop a guesthouse, for example, whererooms formerly occupied by children are converted into rooms for guests, the project may be attractive. Also, if the time spent on tourism enterprises could not be better spenton other pursuits, for example, if few work opportunitiesexist other than in tourism, then a community tourism proj-ect may be worthwhile even if the pay is low. 7.9.6 Experience has shown that tourism often fails to generate local economic benefits when localguides are under-utilised. Tour companies and hotels tend not to use local guides. In some countries and in spe-cific protected areas, they are required to use under-skilledlocal guides, which they often see as a financial drain. This problem may be mitigated through intensive training of local guides in language and interpretation skills.Guides with better skills are more readily accepted bytourist businesses. As tour operators and governmentsrealise that site protection and the health of the tourist trade depend on local support, they begin to see that it isin their interests to support the hiring and training of localpeople. 7.9.7 Raising site revenue to produce local benefits. The costs and benefits of infrastructure and high-techsolutions should be reviewed in light of the goal of pro-ducing local benefits. Planners at the Copan Maya Ruinsin the Honduras realised that luxury hotels tend to belocated away from population centres, limiting opportuni-ties for locals. Noting that most domestic visitors havemodest financial resources and prefer local accommoda-tions, they recommended upgrading existing infrastruc-ture and related services. They also deemed thatconcentrated, modest, but good quality tourist facilitiescould provide many more benefits to local communitiesthan high-class, high-cost hotels, restaurants and guideservices. Such services often use outside labour, are con-trolled by outside capital, and are intentionally locatedoutside local communities. High-tech solutions to management problems should not be adopted without a serious review of their costs, bene-fits and applicability on the ground. In some countries where unemployment is already high, these measures canput even more people out of work. It may be advisableand just as effective, for example, to use local labour tobuild and maintain palm thatch roofs to protect stoneartefacts from deterioration instead of using chemicalcompounds. By the same token, power lawnmowers areobviously more efficient than manual labour for cuttinggrass, but lawnmowers need spare parts that may have tobe imported. Visitor fees can generate benefits for both protected areas and local communities. Most studies on protected areamanagement recommend government policies authoris-ing the collection of fees to offset costs. Fees can becharged for admission to parks or monuments, and fordifferent activities such as diving and trekking, and foraccommodation and rescue services. User fees are equitable because the people who use the site pay for it. Fees for public areas such as parks or muse-ums are kept low to permit access to a greater cross-sec-tion of the population. To capture more foreign exchangeand increase revenues, some sites charge a higher rate forforeign tourists than for nationals e.g., 5.25 for foreignvisitors and 60 cents for nationals at the Copan MayaRuins in Honduras. In countries where such a two-tier sys-tem is illegal, donations can be solicited from foreigntourists and tour companies. It should be noted that achronic problem for many sites that collect fees is that themoney is returned to a central treasury and does not goto site operations. Experts report that the tourism industry may resist visitor charges even though visitors may be willing to pay morefor entrance fees. Visitors tend to accept fee increases ifthey know the funds will go to site protection and con-servation. They want to know where the money goes.Visitor preference data could be collected in support of a fee increase that may be opposed by certain stakeholders. Concession fees charged to individuals or groups licensed to provide services to visitors can also generate revenuesboth for sites and local communities. Common conces-sions include food, lodging, transport, guide and retailservices. Concession fees and royalties can generate sig-nificant income at highly visited sites. Since concessionfees are generally low relative to overall profit levels, busi-nesses may be willing to pay higher fees. Longer stays may raise revenue and still keep visitor num- bers manageable. The availability of an array of visitorservices can increase the average length of stay at a site.At Copan, setting up an interpretation programme,installing new trails and a visitor centre, developing pri-vate guide services, and offering after-dark audio-visualprogrammes in the nearby town all helped increase aver-age visitor stays. At cultural sites with excellent naturalresources, interpretation programmes could emphasise the natural attractions.Strategies and Solutions to Tourism Management Problems 7WH  manual1-ch7 311002 1503 Page 11 74Tour operators may be willing to expand their itineraries to include other attractions and services and thereby raiselocal benefits. A base of operations such as a resort canhave add-on attractions that tourists can visit within a day.Secondary attractions should offer visitors new experiences. Hiring of local staff can improve site management and bring local benefits. Experiences in Australia have shownthe importance of providing employment and training toindigenous people who work as wardens, policy advisersand liaison officers. Permitting local people to sell products can help a com- munitys economy, but may be problematic. Tourists mayfeel threatened by aggressive hawkers, or locals who can-not afford to pay for concession privileges may use unau-thorised areas at a site. At Grand Canyon National Park inthe United States, Native Americans formerly sold handi-crafts near the entrance and at other strategic places anNative American marketplace was set up as an alternative. 7.10 Implications and recommendations  In problem solving for management solutions, the firststep is to analyse all indicators and determine why stan-dards are not being met. Amassing information on usergroups causing problems e.g., day users as opposed totourists staying for longer periods, etc. will help to focusefforts.  When evaluating possible actions, considering the various indirect and direct methods available can be a usefulprocess. Valuable input can be obtained by reviewing thesites goals and objectives during discussions with staff andadvisory body members while considering the scenarios thatcould result from different strategies and actions. Begin bydiscussing indirect strategies such as education and inter-pretation campaigns. Then go progressively to direct actionssuch as enforcement, fines, permits, and so on.  Indirect actions may be adequate initially for addressing problems that are not immediate, for example, when apotentially dangerous area need not be closed, or visita-tion is not increasing too rapidly. The effects of the meas-ures can be evaluated before more restrictive measuresare imposed. A site with limited staff and financialresources may be unable to afford anything other than indirect actions.  Actions should be combined for best results. For exam- ple, an information campaign can be combined with arecreation opportunity spectrum ROS plan that separates users. An education campaign can encourage disparateuser groups to practise their activities in separate areas.For example, mountain bikers can be recommended goodtrails and asked to avoid areas used by bird-watchers.  Costing out different actions on the basis of available staff and other resources will also provide an idea ofwhich actions will be effective. Management actions should not be taken without a thorough analysis and understanding of the socio-culturaland individual importance of a site to the people of thecommunity, for example, when building infrastructure ata sacred site.  A positive atmosphere for introducing management actions can be created by involving stakeholder partnersin planning. Stakeholder partnerships foster dialogueeither with a group causing a problem or with groupsaffected by a problem. These groups can be shown theneeds of the site and the reasons behind certain policies.The tourism advisory board is an effective mechanism forinvolving a wide range of stakeholder partners in visitormanagement issues. Also, future regulations need publicsupport if they are to be implemented successfully.  In general, at natural sites with limited resources, strate- gies that concentrate visitors should be encouraged.Dispersal strategies should be avoided unless sufficientresources are available for educational campaigns and regulatory controls. If there is a need to open an area for a new user group, for example, a new trail for mountainbike riders, then at the very least, a friendly, non-con-frontational dialogue with the new visitors should bestarted.  At cultural sites, dispersal may be effective with enough staff to ensure the protection of resources.  Involving stakeholders in management actions can aid the implementation process. Hotel owners may be willingto help implement certain educational programmes, dis-tributing information on low-impact practices to users.School groups may contribute manual labour. Staff mayhave contacts with the media and launch education cam-paigns with the assistance of this stakeholder partner, dis-seminating news of site management polices andactivities.  Partnership relations can also contribute to enforcement efforts. Partners in local communities who are sympathet-ic to protection and preservation programmes are the bestdefence against illegal activities. Enforcement officerssuch as rangers or security patrols at archaeological sitescan be expensive. Local people allied with the site mayinstead be counted on to signal illegal activities. Educatinglocal residents about the sites efforts to control illegalactivities, while certainly not a panacea, can win friendsand encourage cooperation in efforts to locate offenders.  Identifying local skills will help determine which activities are feasible. Note that not everyone need benefit directlyrevenue from a project may provide support for commu- nity development activities. The link between a tourismproject, its benefits and conservation activities should beobvious. Strategies and Solutions to Tourism Management Problems7WH  manual1-ch7 311002 1503 Page 12 75Suggested Activities 1.If standards are not being met, determine why not.  Review the list of indicators and related cause-and- effect factors. If the impact is caused by tourists, identify thegroups involved. Open a dialogue with the group and determine man-agement actions. Evaluate the effects of various indirect and directmethods on an impact, including local social, culturaland economic factors start with indirect actions andmove progressively to direct strategies. Discuss with staff and advisory group members thescenarios that would result from the different actions. Estimate the costs of different actions, taking intoconsideration staffing needs, and determine whethersome actions can be combined. 2.Inform stakeholders of the actions taken.  Use the tourism advisory board as a platform for dis- cussing the proposed actions. Dialogue with those who may be affected to demon-strate the needs of the site and explain why certainactions are necessary and how they will be implemented. Attempt to create partnership agreements and involvestakeholders in carrying out management actions. Suggested Reading Chase-Harrell, Pauline.

If asite can accommodate greater numbers, and has amechanism for retaining tourism earnings, it can bepromoted to draw in additional visitors and generateincreased revenue for sustaining operations, solvingmanagement problems and meeting goals and objec-tives. Many simple and low-cost promotional actionsare possible the manager can select those that arewithin the sites capacity to carry out. In addition,many of the skills and materials involved overlapwith those used in interpretation programmes. 8.1 Promoting a site to help finance man- agement operations 8.1.1 A portion of visitor fees should be set aside to help finance promotional activities. This will start the cycle of attracting additional visitors, thereby generatingincreased revenue for operations. A mechanism should beset up for retaining a portion of the earnings. This will cre-ate the necessary incentive to promote increased visita-tion. Even with such a mechanism in place, some sitesmay need outside funding to begin developing promo-tional materials international organisations can beapproached for such assistance. 8.1.2 The site manager should decide which type of visitors to target in a promotional campaign on thebasis of the sites policy and management objec-tives. Certain types of tourism fit a sites goals and objec- tives better than others. As with any management action,promotional campaigns should reflect the sites stated pol-icy vision statement and objectives. For example, at natu-ral sites, if local economic development is an objective,managers may wish to promote bird-watching or trekkingwhere local people may be hired as guides or drivers. Atan archaeological site affected by theft of objects destinedfor trafficking in stolen art, a promotional programmemay be designed to attract better-off visitors who are will-ing to pay an extra fee to support an artisan cooperativemaking high-quality replicas of objects at the site. Thesecan then be sold to satisfy a portion of the demand fed bytrafficking. 8.1.3 Dividing visitors into groups according to their characteristics, referred to as market segmentation,permits managers to set up well-directed promo-tional links between different consumers and organ-isations. The segmentation process requires research into the characteristics and preferences of visitors who maywant to come to a site. Distinct segments of consumersmight include those belonging to museum associations ororganisations for the protection of wildlife. Identifyingpeople with similar motivations and needs enables themanager to pinpoint the types of promotional materialsneeded. A simple example is an elderly target audience,for whom promotional materials can be in larger print andmay list special services for senior citizens.To be selected for management action, a market segment must have three characteristics  it must be measurable,  it should be easy to reach through promotional distri- bution systems, and  it should promise increased earnings sufficient to more than repay the costs of targeting it with promo-tional materials. 8.1.4 Knowing how tourists inform themselves on a site they wish to visit will help identify where tofocus promotional efforts. For example, since most eco-tourists wishing to see polar bears in Manitoba,Canada, seek information from travel agents, the sitesmanagers are wise to send their promotional materials totravel agencies. However, since few travel agencies areable or willing to stock the full range of availablebrochures and are ill-prepared to deal with specialisedinquiries, a more efficient approach may be to sendagents a brochure and then contact them personally tobrief them on the sites attractions and the logistics ofreaching it. 8.1.5 Developing a theme using a sites central message for the parks promotion helps developmarketing and promotional materials. Combining a sites most attractive elements to develop slogans orsoundbites, will facilitate the design and creation ofbrochures and interpretation displays. For instance, a parkcould be the best kept secret in the Caribbean, or theplace where billions of years of nature meet thousandsof years of history. 8.1.6 An analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportu- nities and threats SWOT can be used to identifygaps between a sites promotion strategy andtourism trends. A SWOT analysis is a marketing tool used to evaluate a sites promotional abilities by examin-ing the strengths and weaknesses of its promotionalorganisation, financial and staff resources, and existingpromotional strategy. Strengths and weaknesses are con-sidered factors over which the site has some controlopportunities and threats are external. The analysis resultsin a matrix comparing the results. Strengths and weaknesses include  the ways in which the site is being marketed, the size of the marketing budget, performance measures andthe degree and nature of the staffs involvement inmarketing efforts  the sites tourism products, including the quality of service, image and reputation  a profile of current visitors suppliers and the quality of goods and services they provide  the people who handle any marketing for the site and the image they promote, for example, the way it ispresented by tour operators compared with the sitesown promotional materials8Promoting a Site 78WH  manual1-ch8 311002 1505 Page 2 Opportunities and threats include  political factors, including government legislation economic factors social factors competition, identifying competitors and analysing their strengths and weaknesses A known drawback of this analysis is that it is carried out at one point in time but may guide policy over severalyears during which both internal and external changes arelikely that would necessitate modifications to the strategicplan. 8.1.7 Managers without sufficient time or staff to carry out promotional tasks may consider seekingoutside assistance. Tasks such as writing to guidebook publishers, magazines and newspapers to publicise attrac-tions and present management issues are time-consumingand vie for a managers attention. An independent pro-motional organisation representing the different interestgroups may provide a solution. Such a group can analysea sites tourism market and management realities. It hasthe further virtue of being independent, so that it canbridge gaps between competing interest groups. A group such as an NGO with ties to the site and that knows the tourism business, or a government group witha mandate to coordinate all the stakeholders could playthis role. An independent organisation set up to facilitatetourism and park promotion at Lake Baikal, Russia, pro-duced a guidebook giving the names of local tour opera-tors and guides, and distributed it in North America,Europe and Japan. If an outside organisation is solicited, it must be given clear direction so that its output reflects the sites goalsand objectives. For example, if a goal is to support localentrepreneurs, such as ground operators, the organisationmust ensure that it promotes both smaller local operatorsas well as larger or regional and national companies. 8.1.8 Developing a sites tourism identity is an essential element of a promotional strategy. This identity, which is based on the sites goals, objectives andmarket potential, becomes associated with the site in theminds of potential visitors. It could centre on a famousfresco or an endangered animal, for example, and be usedto develop a logo for future promotional activities. 8.2 Strategies for promoting a site 8.2.1 International tourist guidebooks can be a freesource of promotion. Guidebooks are a popular source of information for trip planning and are available foralmost every country and region of the world. Becauseguidebook information is constantly changing, new edi-tions are regularly updated, and editors are usually willingto publish information free of charge. This presents anopportunity to have information on a site and local attrac-tions and services distributed to a wide audience.Sample Fact Sheet to be Sent to Editors of Guidebooks,Magazines and Newspapers The _________ Project is a new tourism initiative at the ______________ World Heritage site involving local com-munity members and non-governmental organisations.The idea of the project is to develop a historic route run-ning through _____________ name of community,which will attract tourists and generate employment andincome for local people. The economic benefits derivedfrom the development are expected to provide an incen-tive for local people to preserve the areas rich culturalheritage. The community is located only _______ kilometres from ____________. The route itself starts at the main gate andwinds its way through the ancient streets and plazas of_____________ name of community, giving tourists theopportunity to visit an array of historic homes andBuddhist temples. High-quality handicrafts are sold atlocal markets along the way. AccessAccess to _____________ name of community is relative- ly easy. It is only half an hour from name of nearby town,city ______ and can be reached easily in a rented car ortaxi. In name of town, city _________ , taxis can behired at the ________ hotel for  ___________ .For trav-ellers willing to take public transport, bus s _____ and_____ leave regularly from the main square. AccommodationsFor tourists wishing to spend the night, there are two locally owned pensions, the ___________________ andthe _________________. Accommodations are simple butclean. Prices are _____for single rooms and _____ fordouble rooms. Reservations can be made by calling orfaxing the number listed below. Two immaculately keptrestaurants serving clean, healthy food are also located inthe community and open for business. Preservation EffortsBecause of the projects focus on preservation and pro- tection, the community members who manage the routeare concerned with the impacts of tourism on the historicbuildings as well as the local culture. Visitors are encour-aged to respect and be sensitive to local cultural valuesand to follow simple rules when visiting the monumentsand temples. Smaller groups are preferred in line with amanagement goal of offering a peaceful and unhurriedexperience. The project is also actively monitoringimpacts to historic buildings, local culture etc. to ensurethat the attractions are protected. A visitor fee of Promoting a Site 8 79WH  manual1-ch8 311002 1505 Page 3 e.g. US5 is collected at the start of the route by local staff. The fee covers a brochure of the route and a guideto the community. The proceeds go directly to preserva-tion and protection efforts. Currently fees are also beingused to fund cultural education at the local school. Giveany concrete examples of projects carried out from thefunding earned. Arrangements for local guides can be made by calling name _________________________________________ at tel. ________________ For other information contactName ______________________________________ Telephone ______________________________________ Fax ______________________________________ e-mail ______________________________________ 8.2.2 Supplying information to travel magazines, newspapers, radio and the internet is another cost-effective way to promote a site. Travel magazines and newspapers publish information on tourism attractionsfree of charge and local radio and television stationsbroadcast such information as a public service. These canall be useful sources of free publicity for the site. In-flightairline magazines reach a large public, and because theyare published quarterly or bimonthly, articles remain in cir-culation for considerable periods. Most publications canbe accessed by the internet and the information trans-ferred in this manner. Sample Press Release Project Name ________________________________ World Heritage Site Address, City, State, Postal Code, Country FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact _______________________________________Phone ________________________________________Fax  __________________________________________ HeadlineCity, Country, DateThe community of ________ City, State, Postal Code, Country, a part of the _______________ World HeritageSite, is inviting interested visitors to see for themselves thecultural attractions of this ancient religious centre. Undera new preservation initiative, the _____________ projectname, a guided route through the community has beenset up as a means of generating funding and an econom-ic incentive to preserve and protect the areas rich culturalheritage. The historic route runs through the centre of this cultural- ly rich community. Sections of the route pass ancient Buddhist monuments made of delicately carved hard- woods and painted in gold. It also passes several speciallyrestored houses, many of them adjacent to the mostbeautiful of the temples. A visitor fee of e.g. US 5 is collected at the start of the route, which is located at the main entrance to the town.Visitation fees go directly to community preservation and protection efforts. Currently the fees help finance ongo-ing restoration efforts and cultural education at localschools. To complement the project, several residentshave developed simple, clean accommodations in some ofthe restored traditional homes. A brochure tracing theroute is available in English, French, German andJapanese. Local guides who speak English, French,German or Japanese are available to accompany visitors. ____________ name of community is only half an hour from the main tourist area at ___________ and can bereached in a rented car or taxi. Advance arrangementscan be made through the ________________ office in________________. Contact __________________ name,telephone _____________, fax _____________, e-mail_______________. Additional information and brochurescan be obtained at the _______________ Tourist Board ine.g., New York, Paris -- give address, telephone etc.. 8.2.3 Brochures can be used to distribute site infor- mation to a wide range of audiences. They can be mailed to national tourism offices, included in promotion-al information sent to tour operators, newspapers, maga-zines, radio and television stations and distributed tohotels. However, unlike other types of promotional mate-rial, brochures are costly to produce, and should bedesigned to remain valid over a long period of time. Mostpeople who receive brochures read them. However,research has found that brochures are likely to exert more influence on people who have not visited a site before andless likely to attract repeat visitors. Compiling a Brochure 1.The size and layout of a brochure will depend on its purpose. For example, if the brochure is to be distributedinternationally it should be formatted to the internationalmailing standard of 21x10 cm and be produced on light-weight paper to save on postage costs. If the brochure isto be displayed on racks at travel agencies in the UnitedStates, the standard size for a brochure is 4x9. If it con-tains a map or other practical information for the touristvisiting the site, it should fit into the pocket or handbag.Larger formats may be used if the brochure is not formailing but, for example, handed out at the site. A verti-cal design with three outside panels opening to threeinside panels is the most common. 8Promoting a Site 80WH  manual1-ch8 311002 1505 Page 4 32. All artwork, photography and titles should be designed to catch and keep the readers attention. Use short,colour ful but honest phrases to describe the communityand its attractions. Emphasise main points, for example,the best preserved remains of Moghul inlaid ornamenta-tion, or 12 kilometres of beautiful, well-developed andeasily walked forest trail. 3. The brochure should briefly describe the sites attractions and points of interest. If nearby attractions can enhancevisitation to the site, they should also be described. 4. If the brochure is to be displayed on a rack, the head- ing should be at the top of the front cover. If there are nophotographs on the front cover, a subheading will inducethe potential visitor to read other panels of the brochure.For example, a brochure could be entitled Royal ChitwanNational Park with the subheading, A WildlifeParadise. All headings, subheadings and text must becarefully written to produce an effective brochure. Theway in which blank spaces, photos and drawings areincorporated is very important. It is useful to solicit severalopinions before deciding on a final format. The backpanel of a brochure usually contains detailed informationsuch as the names and addresses of local hotels as well asother tourism services. 5. The front panel should catch the attention of the target audience, projecting a favourable image of the destinationand stimulating a second glance. Unsuccessful brochuressimply list attractions. Instead, a destinations unique sell-ing points should be highlighted, with particular marketsegments in mind. Photographers, designers and text writ-ers as well as managers should coordinate their efforts sothat the text complements and accentuates the photos.The brochure should be truthful about conditions and sea-sonal changes, as tourists may be disappointed if they visitduring the off-season on the basis of photos showing asite in the most favourable conditions. 6. A brochure need not be exhaustive a collage of small photos usually will not help the reader grasp importantfeatures of a site. A formal, authoritative tone is also tobe avoided. Destination advertising is not usually readfrom cover to cover like a novel. People usually scan theheadings, glance at the pictures and read the captionsbefore deciding to read the text. 7. Key guidelines  Always use international standard sizes.  One good front-panel picture is preferable barring a compelling reason for a multi-picture approach  The brochure should include a map showing land- marks, cities or other tourist destinations near the site.  Contact addresses and telephone numbers should include international dialling codes and include over-seas offices, if applicable.8.2.4 Contacting tour operators directly is a useful means of interesting them in a site. Tour operators are always on the lookout for new attractions to sell to theirclients. Operators, particularly companies that specialise inactivities offered at the site, will appreciate receiving abrochure and any information about the local community.Direct contact with tour operators bypasses travel agen-cies and improves the chances of a positive response. A Sample Visitors Guide A pocketsize visitors guide to Indian sites in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada, describes businesses run bynative communities and entrepreneurs, as well as partner-ships between native people and non-natives. The guidealso contains information about related attractions thatare not necessarily Indian-run, such as museums. It givespractical advice on where and how visitors can enjoy posi-tive encounters with Canadas aboriginal culture. 8.2.5 Producing an information package to area attractions and services can help direct benefits tolocal residents. If one of the goals of a sites tourism pro- gramme is to benefit local communities, a multi-lingualcommunity guide sheet may be a valuable promotionaltool. It can direct visitors to neighbouring destinations andattractions, providing a detailed picture of what the areaoffers, including dining, shopping and accommodations.The information is especially useful for attracting the inde-pendent traveller. Such a package should be distributed tokey points such as hotels in major cities and at nationaltourism offices or embassies abroad. If a site has internet,it can be distributed electronically. A guide can also beused as a management tool for bringing about desired vis-itor behaviour, by for example discussing cultural rulesand taboos and good conservation practices. Such a guidecan be produced by the community with the help of sitemanagement. A local NGO may provide free computertime and translating services. Selling the guide even if it isvery simple may help pay for future copying expenses. Outside Financing Programmes The tourism industry has shown growing interest in financing site management activities, through pro-grammes such as the new UNEP-WTO-UNESCO TourOperators Initiative. Increasing opportunities are likely toarise to involve tour operators in financing World Heritagesite management efforts. As a result, site managers are encouraged to suggest to the World Heritage Centre initiatives for visitor manage-ment and tourism a record of these could be presentedto tour operators seeking opportunities to fund WorldHeritage projects. Promoting a Site 8 81WH  manual1-ch8 311002 1505 Page 5 A 10-page guide which can be easily and cheaply copied may be all that is needed initially. The copy should bestored on a computer, so that the guide booklet can beeasily updated whenever necessary. If and when theattraction becomes more popular, a more sophisticatedguide could be written and sold to cover the costs of pub-lication. Outline for a Guidebook Introduction State the purpose of the guidebook, mentioning concernsfor conservation and historic preservation of WorldHeritage sites, and the importance of tourism to localcommunity development. Background  a brief historical, cultural and natural history of the site,using eye-catching facts  a list of potential activities such as hiking, boating, riverrafting, birding, wildlife photography, visiting historicbuildings and archaeological sites  information on the best time to visit, describing seasonsand rainfall patterns, and giving temperatures in Celsiusand Fahrenheit Access  routes, modes and frequency of available transport tothe site and local communities, including honest assess-ments of safety and reliability where to obtain maps of the area in the capital city Details of the site  what it has to offer culturalhistoricalattractions,wildlife, bird-watching, photography, archaeol-ogy, etc.  fees and why they are charged desired behaviour at the sitevisitor safety  local guides, transport  a simple map of the route recommended clothing and equipment for the differentactivities outstanding fauna and flora rules for viewing wildlife, ruins and historical buildings,including suggestions on low-impact techniques Details of the local community  local customs, traditions and courtesies  regionallocal festivals  places to stay, with current prices, quality of services,number of rooms and beds available  restaurants, snack bars, etc., including advice on whatto eat and what to avoid  sanitary conditions be honest, health precautions forvisitors  available medical carewhere to buy food for hiking andother activities, equipment and other necessities  where to shop for local products and crafts guidesinterpreters speaking English, German, French and Japanese How visitors can contribute to the sites preserva- tion and protection efforts 8.2.6 National tourism offices or embassies can be a free and effective means of distributing promotion-al materials. Tour operators are always on the lookout for new attractions to sell to their clients. Operators, par-ticularly companies that specialise in activities offered atthe site, will appreciate receiving a brochure and anyinformation about the local community. Direct contactwith tour operators bypasses travel agencies and improvesthe chances of a positive response. 8.2.7 Holding a press day can be an effective way to introduce a site to the media. The day can be sched- uled to coincide with a cultural celebration at the site, orit could be a yearly event held to mark the beginning ofthe tourist season. Tour operators, hotel owners and gov-ernment officials who belong to the sites advisory groupcan be recruited to play a role. These stakeholders usuallyhave press contacts and may be interested in obtainingmedia coverage of their activities or businesses. National tourist offices sometimes organise familiarisation tours for travel writers whose expenses paid by the gov-ernment or large tourist enterprises. To get a site includedon a familiarisation tour is not easy, but the manager mayapproach the tourism ministry or perhaps a hotel chainwith promotional materials. If no outside funding is avail-able stakeholders may be able to offer or raise financialsupport. If foreign press are invited, local business peopleare more likely to contribute time and resources to theevent. Familiarisation visits for the international media are most successful if the journalists invited have special intereststhat match the activities of a site, such as the theatre ormarine protection. One method of identifying appropriatejournalists is to find their by-lines in the internationalpress. 8.3 Implications and recommendations  A review of policy goals and objectives will give directionto a promotional campaign. Questions posed during thedevelopment of the promotional programme should echothose posed during the drafting of the vision policy state-ment and management objectives.  Knowing how a particular market segment or group seeks out tourism destinations will help the managerdecide where to focus promotional efforts. Discussionswith the advisory group and other tourism contactsshould provide guidance for determining the best ways todevelop a promotional campaign for these markets andwhere the materials need to be sent.8Promoting a Site 82WH  manual1-ch8 311002 1505 Page 6 3Sample Letter to Tour Operators Use Letterhead Date Tour operators addressCity, state, post code CountryDear Sir or Madam I wish to invite you to visit a new tourism initiative recent-ly launched at the _________ World Heritage site. The________ cultural heritage route initiative is an economicdevelopment project endorsed by the regional and munic-ipal governments and partially funded by ________ e.g.UNESCO. The project aims to provide local residents withan economic incentive to preserve and retain the areasrich cultural heritage. The ________________ name of route runs through the historic community of __________, which is located with-in the area of the World Heritage site and is well knownby archaeologists as containing some of the best pre-served Buddhist temples representative of the __________period. The route starts at __________ and runs throughthe community for a total of 2.5 kilometres 1.5 miles,with signposts indicating historic sites and temples. Asmall brochure on the route is available in English, French,German and Japanese. Local guides who speak these lan-guages are also available. The route offers opportunitiesto explore as well as to shop for handicrafts along theway. In addition, several community members can provideaccommodation in e.g., small hotels, guesthouses. Enclosed is a ____________ fact sheet, brochure, and regional guide outlining the available attractions. I will bepleased to provide any further information about the site,the community or the region. In addition, we will accom-modate you free of charge if you wish to visit the site andsample the route. Please feel free to contact me at the above address or call me on __________________ telephone. I look forward tohearing from you and hope you can support our efforts tobalance conservation and economic development. Sincerely,____________________, Director ____________________ World Heritage site  An analysis of market potential should begin with a fresh examination of the sites attractions and resources.Does the site first need to increase visitation by targetingthe independent market, or is it ready to reach out to touroperators geared towards a single specialised activity suchas bird-watching? Do the site and the surrounding areashave enough attractions and infrastructure to appeal to amore general tourism market? Could the site serve as a day attraction that could be included in a general tour ofthe region, in which case firms interested in this type ofadd-on attraction should be contacted? Next, to deter-mine the types of promotional materials needed, existingor newly commissioned visitor data might be analysed fora better idea of market segments. If the steps in this man-ual have been followed, most such information will bereadily available. A review of segmentation data and a SWOT analysis will help managers make decisions anddevise strategies for entering these markets.  If a site has few current visitors and limited funds, pro- motional efforts might begin by targeting the independ-ent traveller, notably by seeking listings in guidebooks.Independent travellers are a valuable source of word-of-mouth recommendations that will be picked up by spe-ciality operators. A mailing list of guidebook editorsshould be kept up to date so that they can be sent a newpackage of materials each year.  A fact sheet should give a brief history of the site and describe surrounding communities, any interesting floraand fauna or archaeological or geological features, as wellas the activities available to the tourist. It should provide aconcise overview of attractions and services, includingmeans of transport to the site, accommodations, localrestaurants or cafes, and details such as the driving time from the nearest population centres. Local services shouldbe described realistically and honestly if accommodationsare rustic and the guides speak no foreign languages, thefact sheet should say so. Ideally, a multilingual contactperson in the target country should also be listed, sincepotential visitors are often reluctant to call abroad forinformation.  Promotional efforts can focus on developing an identity for a site, to be reflected in promotional materials in theform of a logo, mascot or slogan that help to give the sitean image. Tourism professionals such as tour operatorsfamiliar with international markets can be a source ofadvice when developing this identity.  Tour operators can be sent a fact sheet, brochure and guide, along with a covering letter, to provide a goodoverview of what is available at the site and the sur-rounding area. The mailing should target operators that match the sites attractions, for example, firms specialisingin bird-watching. Restaurant and guesthouse owners innearby communities may be prepared to offer visiting touroperators complimentary accommodations and meals toadd to the attractiveness of visiting a site. A tour operatormay be willing to help by handling inquiries or providinginformation about the site on their website.  A brochure can be a useful promotional tool both for the site and the surrounding communities. The brochureshould be mailed or e-mailed to the national tourismboard or commission, tour operators and newspaper andmagazine editors. It can also be displayed in hotels andPromoting a Site 8 83WH  manual1-ch8 311002 1505 Page 7 guesthouses of tourism centres, as well as in neighbour- ing towns and cities as well as foreign capitals. If the sitehas many repeat visitors, the brochure should be updatedfrequently, or new inserts can be printed to feature newattractions. If local economic development is a priority thebrochure should highlight the unique features of both thesite and the surrounding communities.  A tourist guide to a community should be geared to the appropriate market segment, be it independent, speciali-ty or general travel. The guides style will vary accordingly.For example, a guide to a Nepalese mountain communitymay highlight services available for adventure travellers.Copies of the guide should be sent free or e-mailed to theeditors of guidebooks, magazines and newspapers as wellas to tour operators. Selling the guide elsewhere may helppay for copying expenses.  Direct contact with tour operators may prompt them to visit the site to evaluate its tourism potential, and caneffectively increase name recognition. Ground operatorsin the capital city should also be informed of a sites activ-ities, as they are in contact with tour operators abroad.Scientists carrying out research at or near the site can alsobe approached with the aim of attracting other spe-cialised visitors.  Mailings to the editors of travel magazines and news- paper travel sections, and to the broadcast media if feasi-ble, should include a covering letter and press release,preferably in the target language. Faxing or e-mailing thematerials, if possible, is often more reliable.  A press release should be no more than four paragraphs long to be user friendly. Short sentences and bullet listsare preferable to lengthy narratives. If high-quality pic-tures commissioned from a professional photographercan be included, so much the better.  A mailing list of local newspapers, radio and television stations can be compiled from the Yellow Pages underheadings such as the following News services Newspapers and magazinesRadio stationsTelevision Satellite and cable systemsBroadcasting stations - radioBroadcasting stations -televisionCable televisionPublishers books and magazinesPublishers directories and guides The addresses of in-flight airline magazines can be obtained by calling their local offices. Airlines to be tar-geted should link the site to route points in the UnitedStates and Europe, for example China Airlines and ThaiAirways. Newspaper and magazine editors like human-interest stories, such as an article profiling a local guide, or a site staff member. A press trip should be arranged by formal invitation. One of the sample letters shown in the boxes can be easilymodified for this purpose. Local operators from the advi-sory group might be willing to follow up with phone calls.A lunch or cocktail party possibly underwritten by a localrestaurant owner would give the travel writers a chance to debrief and talk among themselves. Suggested Activities 1.Outline the promotional campaign  Review policy goals and management objectives and determine how a particular.market segment or groupselects destinations and makes travel bookings. Re-examine the sites tourism potential and carry outa SWOT analysis. Discuss with the advisory group andother contacts how best to develop promotional mate-rials for these markets and where they should be sent. 2.Contact the editors of tourist guidebooks  Use the sample letter contained in this manual as a guide. Enclose a separate fact sheet with the letter or e-mail. Maintain a mailing list and send or e-mail a new pack-age of materials each year. 3.Create a brochure  Describe community services and attractions.  Include a copy in all mailings. Display brochures in hotels and guesthouses. 4.Write a community tourism guide  Outline the services the community can provide for each travel market segment. Provide accurate and honest information. Send and e-mail a copy to guidebook, magazine andnewspaper editors as well as tour operators. 5.Contact tour operators  Send and e-mail a promotional package including a covering letter, fact sheet, brochure and guide to spe-ciality tour operators. Contact ground operators in the capital and scientistscarrying out research in or near the site to inform themof available activities. Approach restaurant and guesthouse owners in near-by communities for offers of complimentary meals or accommodations for visiting tour operators.8Promoting a Site 84WH  manual1-ch8 311002 1505 Page 8 36.Contact travel magazine, newspaper, TV and radio editors.  Write a press release and covering letter using the samples in this manual. Fax or e-mail, and mail the material. 7.Submit an article to an in-flight airline magazine.  Contact the airlines local offices.  Concentrate on airlines with route points in North America and Europe.  Offer human-interest stories. Arrange a press trip, identifying members of the press who should have a special interest in the site.  Modify the sample letter shown on page 120 and send out a formal invitation.  Convince local operators from the advisory group to fol- low up with phone calls. Suggested Reading Hall, C. Michael, and Simon McArthur. Heritage Management An Introductory Framework, in C.

Bias will be avoided bystudying visitor patterns over an entire year, then carryingout proportionally more surveys during busy periods thanduring quiet periods. If this is not possible, results mayhave to be weighted statistically. The survey or interview environment should be relaxed, with limited stress and outside pressure such as by localvendors. The location, whether for filling in a question-naire or giving a face-to-face interview, should also assurea reliable sample and a sufficiently high response rate.  Interviews aimed at collecting information on visitor char- acteristics can be conducted before or after the site visit. Interviews soliciting opinions should be conducted afterthe visit. Interviews aimed at determining why the visitors decid-ed to come to the site will yield more accurate informa-tion if conducted before the visit. Questionnaires seeking visitors evaluation of the siteshould be distributed at the exit. If the site has no officialexit, its natural exits should be identified throughobservation.  Questionnaires may be distributed either with theentrance ticket or by an attendant. Clear instructionsshould indicate where to return the form. THE SAMPLING FRAME The target sample of a survey depends on the objectivesof the exercise. To compile an overall visitor profile, across-section of people coming to the site should be sur-veyed. For more specific questions, the survey can be lim-ited to specific groups, for example, men carryingcameras. The sampling frame is determined by specificcharacteristics of a visitor, and a sampling unit is an indi-vidual who displays those characteristics, such as some-one who has come to the site from Germany, or a femalemember of a tour group. Interviews or questionnaires maybe given to every nth person crossing the gate. However,in order to avoid bias, guidelines on whom to intervieware essential. Surveying every 10th person may not bevalid for large groups. Interviews with visitors who volun-teer may not be representative. A sample size may be decided on the basis of a number of factors  the level of accuracy desired  the requirements of the statistical methods  available resources the anticipated response rate The margin of error depends on the size and representa- tiveness of the sample. SURVEY DESIGN Questions used in interviews or self-completing surveysmay be open or closed. Closed questions offer a fixed set of possible answers. The responses to closed questions are easily coded, andthe questionnaire format is faster and cheaper than othersurvey methods. With questionnaires, the respondent isasked to tick a box, and in face-to-face interviews the var-ious options are read aloud or shown on a prompt card.Closed questions are especially appropriate for concreteinformation about visitor characteristics such as age, sex,education, mode of transport, accommodation etc. Theycan be a discreet way of gathering income statistics. Evenwith issues that would normally elicit more than a simpleyes or no response, closed questions can offer a set list ofopinions. However, such questions may irritate respon-dents because of the loss of spontaneity. Details can belost as the set options limit responses. Open-ended questions have no fixed choices and allow respondents to express a wide array of points of view. They are useful for assessing visitors feelings and viewsand solving mysteries such as why visitors do not visit aparticular area of a World Heritage site. A key advantageof open questions is that respondents can be spontaneousand provide in-depth answers. These can inform anexploratory phase leading to the design of a closed-ques-tion survey. A disadvantage of open questions is that theyare more difficult to code and analyse. They are also moretime-consuming to record, and the risk of interviewer biasis greater. Wording of questions can minimise bias and maximise response rates. Questionnaires should be attractive, user- friendly and require a minimum amount of time to com-plete. The simpler the questions, the less room formisunderstanding. However, the survey questions shouldnot be too general. For example, questions such as howoften, how much and how far can yield results thatcannot be compared. Leading questions and those thatmake assumptions should also be avoided. A pilot ques-tionnaire can uncover potential problems with the word-ing or content of questions and gauge the visitors overallreaction to the survey. Interviews can distinguish indiffer- ence from indecision and help fine-tune the wording ofquestions in a survey. When translating the questionnaireinto the local language, it is worth consulting with thetranslator to ensure that the translation does not skew theresult. Question sequencing should be designed to maximise the rate of response. Any interview or survey should beginwith an explanation of the objective as well as an assur-ance of confidentiality. The first questions should capturethe attention of the respondent, while sensitive questionsshould be asked at the end. Personal details should alsobe left for the end and the respondent should be assuredWH  manual1-app1 311002 1508 Page 2 Tourist Surveys Techniques and Samples 89that the answers to these are confidential. Important questions are best asked in the middle of the surveyinter-view, and sudden jumps from one topic to another shouldbe avoided.

The US dollar is the currency used most often in the trav-el and tourism industry, but some respondents may preferto answer in their own currency. Assorted tips for survey work and interviewingSelf-completing questionnaires tend to be completed by visitors who are not satisfied. Interviewers should be trained to guarantee consistency. Questions should be reviewed carefully to avoid any mis-understandings, and interviewers should be familiar withthe survey objectives and methodology, particularly theguidelines for determining whom to survey. Interviewers should avoidChatting about other subjects Misleading respondents about the length andor contentof the questionnaireGiving opinions about the respondents answersAllowing the respondent to see the questionnaireInterviewing children without appropriate permission.WH  manual1-app1 311002 1508 Page 5 Tourist Surveys Techniques and Samples 92Common sources of interview bias include Cheating -- the interviewer may falsify the data by making up the responses.Influencing the interviewee, especially on sensitive questions the interviewers appearance may also influ-ence the respondentErrors when asking questionsErrors when recording the answers -- carelessness inticking boxes andor inaccurate or incomplete recordingof responses to open questions Analysing the dataProcessing the data need not be complicated. Simple per- centage calculations can provide extremely useful infor-mation on the situation at the site. As with monitoring,data processing should be consistent over the long termso that patterns can be observed. A benchmark should be set before the exercise begins stating a minimum percentage of completed question-naires needed to consider the survey valid. StatisticsStatistics are the result of specific calculations of quantita- tive data. Many computer software packages can performstatistical analyses, but require knowledge of the mainanalytical principles and techniques.WH  manual1-app1 311002 1508 Page 6 International Cultural Tourism Charter Paris, Banks of the Seine, France  Art PedersenAppendix 2 93WH  manual1-app2 311002 1511 Page 1 International Cultural Tourism Charter 94Principle 1 Since domestic and international tourism is among the foremost vehicles for cultural exchange, conservation should provide responsible and well managed opportunities for members of the hostcommunity and visitors to experience and under-stand that communitys heritage and culture at firsthand. 1.1 The natural and cultural heritage is a material and spiritual resource, providing a narrative of his-torical development. It has an important role in modern life and should be made physically, intellectually andoremotively accessible to the general public. Programmesfor the protection and conservation of the physical attrib-utes, intangible aspects, contemporary cultural expres-sions and broad context should facilitate an understandingand appreciation of the heritage significance by the hostcommunity and the visitor in an equitable and affordablemanner. 1.2 Individual aspects of natural and cultural heritage have differing levels of significance, somewith universal values, others of national, regional orlocal importance. Interpretation programmes should present that significance in a relevant and accessible man-ner to the host community and the visitor, with appropri-ate, stimulating and contemporary forms of education,media, technology and personal explanation of historical,environmental and cultural information. 1.3 Interpretation and presentation programmes should facilitate and encourage the high level ofpublic awareness and support necessary for thelong-term survival of the natural and cultural heritage. 1.4 Interpretation programmes should present the significance of heritage places, traditions and cultur-al practices within the past experience and presentdiversities of the area and the host community,including that of minority cultural or linguisticgroups. The visitor should always be informed of the dif- fering cultural values that may be ascribed to a particularheritage resource. Principle 2 The relationship between heritage places andtourism is dynamic and may involve conflicting val-ues. It should be managed in a sustainable way forpresent and future generations. 2.1 Places of heritage significance have an intrinsic value for all people as an important basis for cultural diversity and social development. The long- term protection and conservation of living cultures, heritage places, collections, their physical and ecologicalintegrity and their environmental context should be anessential component of social, economic, political, legisla-tive, cultural and tourism development policies. 2.2 The interaction between heritage resources or values and tourism is dynamic and ever changing,generating both opportunities and challenges, aswell as potential conflicts. Tourism projects, activities and developments should achieve positive outcomes andminimise adverse impacts on the heritage and lifestyles ofthe host community, while responding to the needs andaspirations of the visitor. 2.3 Conservation, interpretation and tourism devel- opment programmes should be based on a compre-hensive understanding of the specific but oftencomplex or conflicting aspects of heritage signifi-cance of the particular place. Continuing research and consultation are important to furthering the evolvingunderstanding and appreciation of that significance. 2.4 The maintenance of the authenticity of heritage places and collections is important. It is an essential element of their cultural significance, as expressed in thephysical material, collected memory and intangible tradi-tions that remain from the past. Programmes should pres-ent and interpret the authenticity of places and culturalexperiences to enhance the appreciation and understand-ing of that cultural heritage. 2.5 Tourism development and infrastructure projects should take account of the aesthetic, social and cul-tural dimensions, natural and cultural landscapes,bio-diversity characteristics and the broader visualcontext of heritage places. Preference should be given to using local materials and take account of local archi-tectural styles or vernacular traditions. 2.6 Before heritage places are promoted or devel- oped for increased tourism, management plansshould assess the natural and cultural values of theresource. They should then establish appropriate limits of acceptable change, particularly in relation to the impact ofvisitor numbers on the physical characteristics, integrity,ecology and bio-diversity of the place, local access andtransportation systems and the social, economic and cul-tural wellbeing of the host community. If the likely level ofchange is unacceptable the development proposal shouldbe modified. 2.7 There should be ongoing programmes of evalua- tion to assess the progressive impacts of tourismactivities and development on the particular place orcommunity.WH  manual1-app2 311002 1511 Page 2 International Cultural Tourism Charter 95Principle 3 Conservation and Tourism Planning for Heritage Places should ensure that the Visitor Experiencewould be worthwhile, satisfying and enjoyable. 3.1 Conservation and tourism programmes should present high-quality information to optimise the vis-itors understanding of the significant heritage char-acteristics and of the need for their protection,enabling the visitor to enjoy the place in an appro-priate manner. 3.2 Visitors should be able to experience the her- itage place at their own pace, if they so choose.Specific circulation routes may be necessary to minimiseimpacts on the integrity and physical fabric of a place, itsnatural and cultural characteristics. 3.3 Respect for the sanctity of spiritual places, prac- tices and traditions is an important consideration forsite managers, visitors, policy makers, planners andtourism operators. Visitors should be encouraged to behave as welcome guests, respecting the values andlifestyles of the host community, rejecting possible theft orillicit trade in cultural property and conducting themselvesin a responsible manner which would generate a renewedwelcome, should they return. 3.4 Planning for tourism activities should provide appropriate facilities for the comfort, safety andwellbeing of the visitor that enhance the enjoymentof the visit but do not adversely impact on the sig-nificant features or ecological characteristics. Principle 4 Host communities and indigenous peoples shouldbe involved in planning for conservation andtourism. 4.1 The rights and interests of the host community, at regional and local levels, property owners and rel-evant indigenous peoples who may exercise tradi-tional rights or responsibilities over their own landand its significant sites, should be respected. They should be involved in establishing goals, strategies,policies and protocols for the identification, conservation,management, presentation and interpretation of theirheritage resources, cultural practices and contemporarycultural expressions, in the tourism context. 4.2 While the heritage of any specific place or region may have a universal dimension, the needs andwishes of some communities or indigenous peoples to restrict or manage physical, spiritual or intellectu-al access to certain cultural practices, knowledge, beliefs, activities, artefacts or sites should berespected. Principle 5 Tourism and conservation activities should benefit the host community. 5.1 Policy makers should promote measures for the equitable distribution of the benefits of tourism tobe shared across countries or regions, improving thelevels of socio-economic development and con-tributing where necessary to poverty alleviation. 5.2 Conservation management and tourism activi- ties should provide equitable economic, social andcultural benefits to the men and women of the hostor local community at all levels, through education,training and the creation of full-time employmentopportunities. 5.3 A significant proportion of the revenue specifi- cally derived from tourism programmes to heritageplaces should be allotted to the protection, conser-vation and presentation of those places, includingtheir natural and cultural contexts. Where possible, visitors should be advised of this revenue allocation. 5.4 Tourism programmes should encourage the training and employment of guides and site inter-preters from the host community to enhance theskills of local people in the presentation and inter-pretation of their cultural values. 5.5 Heritage interpretation and education pro- grammes among the people of the host communityshould encourage the involvement of local site inter-preters. The programmes should promote a knowledge and respect for their heritage, encouraging the local peo-ple to take a direct interest in its care and conservation. 5.6 Conservation management and tourism pro- grammes should include education and trainingopportunities for policy makers, planners,researchers, designers, architects, interpreters, con- servators and tourism operators. Participants should be encouraged to understand and help resolve at timesconflicting issues, opportunities and problems encoun-tered by their colleagues.WH  manual1-app2 311002 1511 Page 3 International Cultural Tourism Charter 96Principle 6 Tourism promotion programmes should protect and enhance Natural and Cultural Heritage characteristics. 6.1 Tourism promotion programmes should create realistic expectations and responsibly inform poten- tial visitors of the specific heritage characteristics ofa place or host community, thereby encouragingthem to behave appropriately. 6.2 Places and collections of heritage significance should be promoted and managed in ways whichprotect their authenticity and enhance the visitorexperience by minimising fluctuations in arrivalsand avoiding excessive numbers of visitors at anyone time. 6.3 Tourism promotion programmes should provide a wider distribution of benefits and relieve the pres-sures on more popular places by encouraging visi-tors to experience the wider cultural and naturalheritage characteristics of the region or locality. 6.4 The promotion, distribution and sale of local crafts and other products should provide a reason-able social and economic return to the host commu-nity, while ensuring that their cultural integrity isnot degraded.WH  manual1-app2 311002 1511 Page 4 For more information contact UNESCO World Heritage Centre 7, place de Fontenoy 75352 Paris 07 SP FranceTel  33 01 45 68 18 76 Fax  33 01 45 68 55 70E-mail  wh-infounesco.orghttpwhc.unesco.org World Heritage manualsWorld Heritagemanuals Cover photo  UNESCON.Saunier World Heritagemanuals Managing Tourism at World Heritage Sites a Practical Manual for World Heritage Site Managers By Arthur PedersenManaging Tourism at World Heritage Sites a Practical Manual for World Heritage Site Managers For more information contact United Nations Environment ProgrammeDivision of Technology, Industry and Economics Tour Mirabeau, 39-43 Quai André Citroën 75739 Paris - Cedex 15, FranceTel.  33 01 44 37 14 50 Fax  33 01 44 37 14 74E-mail uneptieunep.frhttpwww.uneptie.orgtourismhome.html Cover printed on chlorine free paper interior printed on recycled paper Designed by RectoVersoWH  manual1- cover 311002 1440 Page 1", "chunks": [{"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_0", "original_index": 0, "content": "For more information contact UNESCO World Heritage Centre 7, place de Fontenoy 75352 Paris 07 SP FranceTel  33 01 45 68 18 76 Fax  33 01 45 68 55 70E-mail  wh-infounesco.orghttpwhc.unesco.org World Heritage manualsWorld Heritagemanuals Cover photo  UNESCON.Saunier World Heritagemanuals Managing Tourism at World Heritage Sites a Practical Manual for World Heritage Site Managers By Arthur PedersenManaging Tourism at World Heritage Sites a Practical Manual for World Heritage Site Managers For more information contact United Nations Environment ProgrammeDivision of Technology, Industry and Economics Tour Mirabeau, 39-43 Quai André Citroën 75739 Paris - Cedex 15, FranceTel. 33 01 44 37 14 50 Fax  33 01 44 37 14 74E-mail uneptieunep.frhttpwww.uneptie.orgtourismhome.html Cover printed on chlorine free paper interior printed on recycled paper Designed by RectoVersoWH  manual1- cover 311002 1440 Page 1 Managing Tourism at World Heritage Sites a Practical Manual for World Heritage Site Managers By Arthur PedersenWH  manual1-intro 311002 1402 Page 1 Disclaimer The author is responsible for the choice and presentation of the facts contained in this publication and for the opinions expressed therein, which are not necessarily those of UNESCO and do not commit the Organization.

So how do we merge our convic-tions with our concerns over the impact of tourism on World Heritage sites? The answer is through sustainable tourism. Directing governments, site managers and visitors towards sustainable tourismpractices is the only way to ensure the safekeeping of our worlds natural and cultural heritage. In 2002, the international communitys virtually undivided attention was focused on tourism and its impact on our cultural and natural heritage. It started with the United Nations declaration of 2002 as theYear for Cultural Heritage. Then in May, Québec City hosted the first ever World Ecotourism Summit,whose Declaration on the development of Ecotourism in the context of sustainable development waslater delivered at the Johannesburg World Summit. In November, heritage, tourism and developmentis one of the focuses of the International Congress in Venice on the occasion of the 30th anniversary ofthe World Heritage Convention. Through the publication of this manual, we aim to harness this momen-tum by putting all of the ideas, theories and plans for sustainable tourism into action. By learning to tread lightly on the earth, not only are we ensuring the future of World Heritage sites but also the future of tourism. Its a win-win situation for everyone involved the site is better protect-ed and maintained, the tourist experiences a more pleasant visit, and the local economy is boosted as aresult. Tourism is an important management issue at both natural and cultural World Heritage sites. It is an industry with well-known costs but also with the potential for aiding protection efforts. We recognizethis potential and are convinced that by engaging, and by taking appropriate actions at the different levels of the sustainable tourism process, tourism can be managed to generate net site benefits.", "tokens": 379}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_2", "original_index": 2, "content": "Thismanual outlines a process to guide site managers toward this end.

Francesco Bandarin Director, UNESCO, World Heritage CentreParis, FranceForeword 3WH  manual1-intro 311002 1402 Page 3 I am proud to present this manual, another valuable contribution to the International Year of Ecotourism in 2002. Tourism is one of the worlds largest industries, with almost 700 million international tourists in2002, and can become an essential tool in the challenge to overcome biodiversity losses and eradicatepoverty, particularly in sensitive ecosystems and protected areas. The basic fact is that a healthy socialand natural environment is the first and most important asset for this global industry. It makes businesssense for tourism stakeholders to be natural allies of sustainability. Protected areas, particularly World Heritage sites, are some of tourisms main attractions, and are subject to growing visitation. World Heritage sites are outstanding cultural and natural landscapes covering allkinds of ecosystems, which are carefully selected through a process resulting from a 1972 multilateralagreement involving 175 countries. Maintaining such sites requires adequate practices to guaranteeenvironmentally sound management of the park and at the same time to ensure that local communitiesbenefit from the parks existence. The potential economic benefits that tourism can bring do not materialize without careful planning.

In 2002, UNEP, IUCN and the World Tourism Organization published a book entitled Sustainable Tourism in Protected Areas written by Dr. Paul Eagles of the World Commission on Protected Areas, with the contribution of many other international experts. This book aims at building a better understanding ofissues related to tourism in protected areas and providing guidelines on how to address them. The pres-ent manual effectively complements the previous publication it addresses the specific needs of WorldHeritage site managers and guides them through the visitor planning and management process. It is onemore milestone in UNEPs long collaboration with UNESCO on improving benefits to protected areasthrough sustainable tourism.

In fact this manual is just the start of a projected series of manuals for World Heritage site managers on tourism issues. Why the focus on World Heritage sites? Perhaps this is best explained by a question fromthe Chief of the Natural Heritage Section of the World Heritage Centre, Natarajan Ishwaran, who onceasked, If we cant save World Heritage sites, what can we save? I have taken this to heart. As I continueto work with World Heritage sites I have come to realize the important role of the World HeritageConvention. What this manual does, and why it may be different than others, is that it synthesizes the logical and holistic process of tourism and visitor management reflected in management literature. It has been myexperience that if one understands the process of a subject and has a global vision of how things fittogether, it is much easier to wade through the array of technical details that compose most modernfields. Without this knowledge, those who arent specialists can get lost in the complexity. Successful, sustainable tourism calls for a process of close engagement. It involves having clear ideas on goals and objectives, knowing where you want to go, setting these goals and objectives within the constraints of legal and social rules and then negotiating with relevant interest groups to try to incor-porate their needs into the mix. It also means continually monitoring to see if these elusive targets arebeing reached and, if they are not, deciding what actions to take to get the programme back on track.This whole process is simple in theory but difficult to implement and sustain in practice.

The World Travel and Tourism Council WTTC estimates that tourism generates some 12 of the world total GNP . With studies predicting continued growth, tourism is anincreasingly important factor in the planning and management at UNESCO World Heritage sites. While no formal data have been collected, a sites inscription on the World Heritage List often coincides with a boost in visitation rates. Even at current rates, tourism is an important issue at World Heritage sites. A 1993 UNESCO-United Nations Environmental Programme UNEP study showed that most managers of natural sites regard it as akey issue. Interviews and surveys carried out by the World Heritage Centre at cultural sites have revealed similarconcerns. Tourism offers well-known advantages. Visitor fees, concessions and donations provide funds for restoration and protection efforts. Visitors may be recruited as friends of a site and can help generate international support. Touroperators and hotel chains can play a role in the management of a site by making financial contributions, aidingmonitoring efforts, or instructing their clients in responsible tourism.", "tokens": 396}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_6", "original_index": 6, "content": "Tourism can also promote cultural values bysupporting local handicrafts or by offering alternative economic activities. On the downside, tourism spawns well-known problems. Managing rapid tourism growth is a time-consuming process demanding clear policies, ongoing dialogue with stakeholders, and constant monitoring. Tourism activitiesrequire environmental impact assessments EIAs and procedures for minimising impacts. At sites with limited budgets and staff, growing tourism can stretch scarce resources and take managers away from protection efforts. While tourism can contribute to protection and restoration efforts, the right balance between economic gain and undesirable impacts can be elusive. Managers know that a tourist attraction must be periodically renewed to remaincompetitive. In the case of World Heritage sites, they are also aware that they are under an international obligationto maintain or restore the sites original values. This responsibility poses difficult questions regarding the degree ofchange that should be permitted to accommodate tourism growth. Another problem is ensuring that a portion oftourism revenue remains in the community as a means of fostering local protection, conservation and restorationefforts. To meet these and other challenges, managers have requested training and information on World Heritage as well as concrete examples of procedures for addressing tourism planning issues. The World Heritage Centre has respon-ded by increasing its support for training in tourism management skills, including the publication of this manual.

While visitor management poses different issues depending on whether a site is cultural or natural, the two types of sites have many concernsin common, including setting goals and objectives, working with stakeholders, dealing with issues of carrying capa-city, and interpretation and promotional activities. Moreover, many World Heritage sites, though listed as eithernatural or cultural, protect both types of resources. Experience has shown that visitor management is a balancing act requiring the establishment of a tourism policy based on conservation and preservation goals that will be supported by all stakeholders, while respecting legal man-dates, encouraging ongoing debate and monitoring tourism activities. This manual attempts to bring these manyfactors together, to provide managers with a practical framework on which to base their efforts. 12WH  manual1-intro 311002 1402 Page 12 The World Heritage Convention Galàpagos Islands, Equador  UNESCOWHC 13WH  manual1-ch1 311002 1435 Page 1 The World Heritage Convention 14An understanding of the responsibilities assumed under the World Heritage Convention is essential topolicy setting and decision making.", "tokens": 355}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_8", "original_index": 8, "content": "The OperationalGuidelines accompanying the Convention have alarge bearing on tourism management, providinguseful guidance on responsibilities such as periodicreporting.

Knowledge of the structure of the industryhelps managers to identify opportunities for obtain-ing assistance in management and protection effortsthrough tourism. Knowledge of market segmentsand categories can help when writing project propos-als and reports. Information on market segments canalso provide useful input during the development of promotion and interpretation programmes. 2.1 The structure of the tourism industry 2.2.1 The tourism industry is multi-tiered, from thoseresponsible for promotion to those who serve the consumer directly. The industry comprises the following organisational structuresThe main responsibility for promotion of a countrystourism attractions lies with government-funded touristorganisations such as National Tourism Offices NTOs.", "tokens": 456}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_23", "original_index": 23, "content": "NTOs collaborate with hotels and air carriers to raisefinance for destination promotion programmes. Theydevote much of their overseas efforts to establishing rela-tionships with tour operators and travel agencies. NTOssupport new developments or new tours by providingintroductions and influencing development plans affect-ing destinations, as well as legislative or financial policies.They provide support for familiarisation trips, hold promo-tional events and produce research data. Tour operators outbound providers, tour agencies , and ground operators in-country or inbound providers are on the front line of the industry. Tour operators arecompanies that sell tours to customers, either directly orindirectly through travel agents. Tour operators vary insize. Many of the smaller firms handle specialised marketssuch as eco-tourism and adventure travel. They providetravel agents with marketing support, for example byoffering familiarisation visits for staff members. Tour oper-ators often go to the same locations, and promotionalmaterials and brochures tend to look alike. Tour compa-nies try to differentiate their destinations with gradationsof challenge or price, for example at ski resorts, whereaccommodations may be more or less luxurious and theskiing may be more or less difficult. Although TourOperators respond for only about 12  of global tourismflows IFTO, 2002, they can help bridge low travel sea-sons by providing a steadier market, develop new desti-nations and can help define service and infrastructureneeds at local level. In contrast, travel agencies handle a wide variety of trav- el packages available from tour operators and airlines. InEurope and in North America, a high percentage of toursare marketed to the public through travel agencies. InEurope, travel agencies dominate the supply of holidaysand largely determine the information on which mostclients base their holiday decisions. Large tour operators select travel agents to represent them on the basis of the agencys productivity.", "tokens": 388}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_24", "original_index": 24, "content": "Local individuals, national groups,international enterprises or any combination of the threemay own travel agencies. Although website sales to indi-vidual consumers are on the rise, generally, travel agenciessell tours from brochures and the computerised reserva-tion systems of major tour operators. Therefore,brochures are pivotal to the business. However, so manybrochures are available for example, about 4,000 inBritain in 1993, that travel agencies simply cannot stockthe full range. What winds up on their display cases is afunction of the commissions paid by tour operators, theefficiency of their reservation systems, and the strength ofthe business relationship. In general, travel agencies arenot prepared to offer information from outside the corepackage tours that they sell. Related to tour operators are ground operators, or in-coun- try operators who handle logistics or ground operations.They handle tourist groups from the moment of arrival offthe plane or boat, until departure. They can also sell toursin the countries in which they are operating. Ground oper-ators are mostly based in capital cities and are usually well-educated host nationals who can speak several languages.In some countries a key to increasing a sites popularity is tohave reliable ground operators working with tour operatorsin Europe or North America. A scarcity of ground operators,while unlikely to deter independent travellers, may discour-age consumers of organised tours who depend on theirservices. 2.2 International tourism markets The tourism market comprises three general classifications  the independent travel market,  the speciality activity market, and  the general package-holiday market. Independent travellers are not part of organised groups but travel alone or in small groups of friends. They traveleither out of a general interest or because they want topractise a certain activity in a new and different environ-ment.", "tokens": 372}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_25", "original_index": 25, "content": "Most independent travellers are young, adventur-ous, willing to use rustic accommodations, eat traditionalfoods, and take public transport. Independent travellersget much of their information on a tourist destinationeither from friends who have visited the area or throughguidebooks, newspaper and magazine articles, or,increasingly, from the Internet. Many in the tourism indus-try discount these tourists because they tend to travelcheaply, falling into the category of the budget-consciousbackpacking crowd. In reality, independent travellersare explorers who are often responsible for popularis-ing a destination. Their financial input is often enough toenable local businesses to expand and improve rusticaccommodations for more demanding tourist groups.Such travellers, often young, are more willing to use localgoods and services, and interact more with the communi-ty outside the supervision of an organised tour, whichunfortunately may cause negative social impacts.2WH  manual1-ch2 311002 1438 Page 2 The Tourism Industry Implications for Managers 23Speciality tourism firms organise trips for clients wishing to participate in a specific activity such as bird-watching,wildlife viewing, photography or archaeological,historical and cultural tours. Also in this category are adventure travel firms offering activities such as back-packingtrekking, white water rafting, kayaking, canoe-ing, rock climbing and sport fishing. Other speciality firmsorganise field research trips for scientists. These firmsattract groups of paying volunteers who sign up to workas field assistants on projects such as archaeological digsand wildlife monitoring programmes. In addition, thismarket includes organisations and universities with specialinterest travel programmes. For example, the World-wideFund for Nature and many museums organise tours fortheir members. These tours generally help to raise fundsfor a particular cause or project. These groups generallysub-contract to other tour operators to handle the travelarrangements.", "tokens": 380}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_26", "original_index": 26, "content": "Speciality tour operators commonly usehost-country ground operators for in-country logistics.These national firms, based in the country in which thetour is operating, provide all services transportation, hotelaccommodations, guides, etc. from arrival to departure.Some speciality firms in North America and Europe handleground operations in a foreign country for themselves,but they tend to be exceptions to the rule. Managersshould be aware that many speciality companies are smalland go in and out of business rapidly. The general package-holiday market attracts groups wishing to see an area and its culture but without a spe-cific interest in a defined activity or subject matter. Thesetourists tend to be interested in general sightseeing andshopping, and may be interested in cultural attractionssuch as museums, ruins or other well-known or docu-mented historical sites. Tourists in this market tend towant the standard services and amenities offered by mostgeneral tours. They will probably not be satisfied with theservices that a rural community can offer more often thannot, general international tour groups want comfort, easeof access, security and more upscale accommodationsand food. 2.3 Understanding speciality markets 2.3.1 While the bulk of the tourism business contin-ues to be mass-market package holidays, specialisedholidays are growing in popularity. Tourism is more than ever before divided into market segments definingdifferent types of experiences. Specialised holidays caterto peoples particular interests, such as sailing, bird-watch-ing, photography or archaeology. Markets or market seg-ments have been developed around the differentactivities. Specialised holidays have become so popular that whole new categories of travel have emerged, including eco-tourism, adventure travel, heritage tourism and culturaltourism.", "tokens": 351}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_27", "original_index": 27, "content": "A trek in the Himalayas is now likely to be con-sidered adventure travel, and a week visiting cultural sitesin India as cultural tourism.2.3.2 Eco-tourism is one of the most frequently cited categories of the new tourism. It is defined by the International Ecotourism Society as, responsible travel tonatural areas that conserves the environment and sustainsthe well being of local people. A number of activitieshave been labelled eco-tourism, including bird- andwhale-watching, helping scientists conduct conservationresearch, snorkelling off coral reefs, game viewing and nature photography. Eco-tourism is linked to and overlapswith heritage tourism and cultural tourism. Surveys show that eco-tourists tend to be young and highly educated, with professional and managerial occu-pations. Eco-tourism trips tend to be longer, with fewerpeople in the typical tour group. Researchers report thateco-tourists are more likely to use small independenthotels, as opposed to mass tourists, who tend to stay atchain hotels. As would be expected, the eco-tourist isinterested in a more natural environment, preferring lesscrowded destinations that are off the beaten track andthat offer challenging experiences. At the site level, the demands of eco-tourists and main- stream tourists may overlap and be difficult to differenti-ate. Some eco-tourists, for example, may demandcondominiums, not campgrounds, for lodging. People ona bird-watching cruise to Patagonia could be consideredeco-tourists but may have demands similar to those oftourists on an expensive Caribbean islands cruise. In prac-tice, eco-tourism connotes a travel ethic, promoting con-servation behaviours and certain economic policies.Examples are, an emphasis on low-impact techniques forviewing wildlife and a preference for hiring local guides. 2.3.3 Adventure tourism includes a wide range of outdoor activities. Adventure tourists engage in activi- ties that are physically challenging and sometimes dan-gerous, or perceived to be so.", "tokens": 425}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_28", "original_index": 28, "content": "Examples are sports such astrekking, mountaineering, white-water rafting and scubadiving. Adventure tourism does not necessarily requireexpensive facilities and infrastructure, but it does requiregood organisation, guides, transportation services, basicaccommodation in the field, and opportunities for morecomfortable accommodation at the end of the tour.Adventure travel is a rapidly growing sector of the spe-ciality tourism market. 2.3.4 Cultural tourism is frequently used to describe certain segments of the travel market. It may be asso- ciated with visits to historical, artistic and scientific or her-itage attractions. The World Tourism Organisation WTOhas two definitions of cultural tourism. In the narrowsense, cultural tourism includes movements of personsfor essentially cultural motivations such as study tours,performing arts and cultural tours, travel to festivals andother cultural events, visits to sites and monuments, trav-el to study nature, folklore or art, and pilgrimages. In thebroader sense it is defined as all movements of persons,because they satisfy the human need for diversity, tendingto raise the cultural level of the individual and giving rise2WH  manual1-ch2 311002 1438 Page 3 The Tourism Industry Implications for Managers 24to new knowledge, experience and encounters. Because culture is subjective, definitions of cultural tourism tend tobe either too wide or too narrow, limiting their practicaluse in the field. 2.3.5 Heritage tourism is a broad category that embraces both eco-tourism and cultural tourism,with an emphasis on conserving natural and cultur-al heritage. It is a category or market segment that includes visits to historic sites, museums and art galleries,and exploring national and forest parks. Heritage tourism,because of the large number of activities it covers, is diffi-cult to define and measure. In recent years city plannersinterested in urban regeneration have adopted the termto describe many tourism programmes, a strategy that hasreceived support from business and banks.", "tokens": 403}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_29", "original_index": 29, "content": "Many other tourism terms reflect environmental ethics and local interests. Environmental preservation concernshave given rise to what is known as green tourism, con-servation-supporting tourism, and environmentally awareor environmentally sound tourism. Generally, such tourismfavours minimal environmental impact and emphasisesconcern over environmental issues. Urban and ruraltourism categories have also been created. However, sincefew countries have made the distinction, quantificationhas been difficult. 2.4 Sustainable tourism 2.4.1 The idea of sustainability is found in all themarket segments and definitions of the newtourism. All the definitions address preservation of the resource for future generations the use of tourism to con- tribute to environmental protection limiting negativesocio-economic impacts, and benefiting local people eco-nomically and socially. The WTO defines sustainabletourism as Tourism development that meets the needsof the present tourists and host regions while protectingand enhancing opportunity for the future. The desiredoutcome is that resources will be managed in such a waythat economic, social and aesthetic needs can be fulfilledwhile maintaining cultural integrity, essential ecologicalprocesses, biological diversity and life support systems.The term sustainable tourism is frequently used in proj-ect proposals seeking international assistance. In practice, sustainable tourism programmes are an opportunity that also demands hard work. They requireclearly defined goals and objectives that highlight theessential features of sustainability within the local context,an ongoing process of addressing stakeholder needs within the framework of these goals and objectives, andconstant monitoring. As with all sustainable developmentprojects, this process is labour intensive, takes time andusually involves many interest groups, making pro-grammes difficult to design, implement and maintain.", "tokens": 334}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_30", "original_index": 30, "content": "Sustainable tourism programmes have highlighted the need for an environmental and social focus and led to thestandardisation of some environmental practices as wellas new ideas about how the industry should function.Discussion has produced policy goals and guidelines forplanners and an impetus for self-regulation by the industry. 2.5 Tourist types 2.5.1 Seeking definitions that would be more usefulin practice, researchers have concentrated ontourists behaviours and preferences. Definitions and their related market segments, such as adventure travel orcultural tourism, tend to group people into broad cate-gories based on a range of activities. These definitions andactivities necessarily overlap, making it difficult at the sitelevel to differentiate between types of tourism. For exam-ple, eco-tourism and heritage tourism combine aspects ofboth culture and nature, as do most speciality tours. Sofor instance, trekking in the Himalayas is considered anadventure travel activity, but most trekkers visit Buddhistor Hindu cultural sites at the same time. Bird-watchersvisit archaeology sites and frequently engage in trekking.The broad definitions of the international markets are too comprehensive to be used for site-specific decision-making. An effective way of addressing this overlap for research, policy and site management purposes is to classify touristsaccording to their motivations, behaviours and desiredexperiences. Researchers have developed several cate-gories of tourist behaviours and preferences. For example,tourists may be classified according to the intensity ofexperiences they are seeking or the ruggedness of theconditions they desire or will accept, including the kind ofaccommodations expected. Thus Hard-core tourists join tours or groups travelling specifi- cally for educational purposes andor to take part in envi-ronmental or cultural projects, such as wildlife monitoring. Dedicated tourists want to visit protected or cultural areas and understand local natural and cultural history.", "tokens": 373}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_31", "original_index": 31, "content": "Casual tourists consider natural and cultural travel as an incidental component of a broader trip. Another system that is useful for classifying preferences differentiates between hard-class and soft-classtravel. This classification relates to the ruggedness factor,mostly concerning the degree of challenge involved andthe comfort level of accommodations. These categoriesinclude A hard-class experience that is physically difficult with an element of danger. For example, it may require walkingmiles into the back country, climbing a technically difficultmountain, or sleeping in rudimentary shelters.2WH  manual1-ch2 311002 1438 Page 4 The Tourism Industry Implications for Managers 25A soft-class experience means lower risk and more luxu- rious accommodations. For example, a tented safari mayinvolve physically challenging conditions while offeringamenities such as gourmet meals and comfortable transport. 2.6 Tourism trends 2.6.1 Tourists are becoming more interested in envi-ronmental protection. Consumers are increasingly con- sidering environmental quality as well as the quality ofservices as factors in their selection of tourist destinations.More and more consumers want a high standard of envi-ronmental conservation coupled with simple, efficient and pleasant service. It appears that many tourists now preferunspoiled and uncrowded destinations. A related trend is that, before they travel, many tourists inform themselves about environmental problems at indi-vidual sites. They want destinations to be clean and envi-ronmentally sound. Tourists will avoid places that are perceived to fall short of this image. More than ever thisinformation is obtained through the internet. Environmental degradation can lead not only to declining tourism rates but also to changes in the types of touriststhat travel to a site. Examples of this cycle are found in theMediterranean, where the pattern has led to continueddegradation and urbanisation of beach resorts.", "tokens": 380}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_32", "original_index": 32, "content": "2.6.2 Interest in cultural tourism seems to be expanding, but the rate of growth is unclear. More quantitative data is needed to verify the trend. For exam-ple, attendance at cultural attractions in Britain and theNetherlands over the last five years indicates that culturaltourism has kept pace with the overall tourism market. Because the cultural tourism market is difficult to quanti- fy, experts suggest that more research would help to iden-tify broad groupings of cultural tourists based on theirmotivations. Establishing categories such as arts, archae-ology, language learning and so on may be the most prac-tical way to address this issue. 2.6.3 Tourists increasingly want real experiences with other cultures and lifestyles. A study of mass- market tourists and eco-tourists found that both groupsfelt that knowledge of folk arts and handicrafts, as well asknowledge about the destinations history, was important. 2.6.4 Consumers are seeking more active and educa- tional holidays. Specialised markets are experiencing a trend towards energetic, environment-oriented tourism,with healthy menus and plenty of opportunities for exer-cise. Although mass-market tourists are less active andadventuresome, and less focused on one activity, activeholidays at a lower level of intensity are also a growingtrend in this market segment.2.6.5 Visits to protected areas are on the rise. In developed countries, tourists tend to travel in small-er groups for shorter time periods. For example, visits to Australian national parks have increased substantially inthe last ten years, but often for shorter periods. The twotrends together -- smaller group sizes and shorter stays --have created a need for greater individual space and morefacilities designed to accommodate intense use, withextra services added during certain times of the year.", "tokens": 376}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_33", "original_index": 33, "content": "2.6.6 The tourism industry is expected to take more responsibility for sustainable development.Professionals working in conservation are beginning toask the industry to be more involved in site managementactivities. Often this involves assuming a degree of finan-cial responsibility for the long-term maintenance of theresources they profit from. Financial support can be in the form of direct or voluntary subsidies to managementagencies or NGOs. Involvement may also mean acceptingpractices that limit the negative impacts of tourism. Anexample is at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park inAustralia where operators have become increasingly self-regulating and accountable through the establishment of codes of conduct and guidelines for minimal impact prac-tices. Operators at the Great Barrier Reef are also involvedin the monitoring of their sites. The fact that operators areprohibited from relocating their facilities and activitiesonce an existing site is affected by natural or unnaturalenvironmental degradation has reinforced these actions. 2.7 Implications and recommendations  Tourism definitions can give direction to broad policyguidelines used in the development of goals and objec-tives for site management. For example, the InternationalEco-tourism Societys definition of eco-tourism states thattourism should maintain the integrity of an ecosystem andgenerate economic opportunities that make conservationbeneficial to local people. This type of a statement can beincorporated into a policy statement defining the type oftourism a site will promote. Tourism definitions, such as that of eco-tourism, can be used in reports or proposals seeking funding for futureprojects. They can give documents a positive image andstrengthen their attractiveness. Overall development con-cepts and definitions should match the audience forwhom the proposal is being written.", "tokens": 345}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_34", "original_index": 34, "content": "For example, theterm eco-tourism should be used in place of tourismwhen writing to nature conservation organisations cul-tural tourism when writing to organisations concernedwith the restoration of monuments, and so on. Marketdefinitions can then be used in promotional materials. Forexample, a brochure may mention that eco-tourism isencouraged at a particular natural or mixed site. Operators promotional materials give clues as to whether their products are compatible with site objec-tives. Tour operator literature can also help managersdetermine whether operators contribute locally to protec-2WH  manual1-ch2 311002 1438 Page 5 The Tourism Industry Implications for Managers 26tion efforts such as educating clients in low-impact prac- tices. Promotional literature will also reveal the types ofclients they are targeting, what kind of experiences theyvalue and their particular needs. For example, an operatormay specialise in tours geared to a serious, single-mindedbird-watching group or an amateur archaeology group. While knowledge of tourism definitions and speciality tourist markets can help managers set policy guidelinesand understand visitor interests, the categories are gener-al and tend to overlap. For management purposes it isuseful to classify and analyse tourists according to theirpreferences and behaviours. Categories such as hardand soft class provide a helpful start. These categories,which focus on visitor needs and expectations, are impor-tant for elaborating management plans and setting objec-tives including infrastructure development. Knowledge of the different market segments and the general behaviours and preferences of tourists can helpmanagers decide which segments to promote. Differenttourists present different management opportunities andrequirements. For example, tourists seeking more demanding or harder experiences are more likely to becontent with a minimal infrastructure than those seekinga softer experience.", "tokens": 360}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_35", "original_index": 35, "content": "Tour operators such as those work-ing with keen bird-watchers or clients interested inarchaeology may have special market demands.

They may also make direct financial contributionsfor on-site projects. Interviews with tour operators andhotel directors could determine what mechanisms, admin-istrative and financial, would facilitate their contributionsto conservation and protection efforts. A proactive approach will yield benefits if market trends are addressed. Continued growth in international tourismis predicted, particularly in special interest tourism. Thegrowing concern over environmental and socio-culturalissues suggests the existence of a large potential source ofsupport for the site. Socio-economic profiles suggest thatmore and more tourists will have the means to contributefinancially towards protection of the site. Consequently, ifa site is planned and managed well, within defined limits,an increase in arrivals can potentially bring new financialrewards. Because tourists are more conscious of, and interested in, the protection of the natural, historical, cultural andsocial environment, it will be increasingly important toinform tourists and tour operators, through site interpre-tation and promotional activities, of the efforts that man-agement is making to maintain the site.

Impacts caused by touristswithin sites are often quite sensitive but can usually beavoided. For example, visitors can be asked not to feedwildlife or touch rock art. The cause-and-effect relationships of tourism impacts can be difficult to identify. Litter may be dropped by local peo-ple and not by tourists water pollution may come fromupstream sources other than hotels a coral reef may bedamaged by storm and wave action, and not tourismpoaching by local residents may be to blame for decliningwildlife populations. Visitor volume is not necessarily the primary factor influ- encing the amount of impact. Solutions designed to limitnumbers in a given area may not be effective. Nowresearchers know that impacts are linked to a complex set of socio-environmental factors and development patterns.According to current thinking, it is important to under-stand the inter-relationships that cause tourism impactswhich might, for example, lead one community to wel-come tourists while another community develops strongopposition to a tourist presence. The relationship between amount of use and environ- mental impacts is often not linear but curvilinear. That is,initial light use may cause the most damage, while subse-quent use has progressively less impact. For resourcessuch as soils and vegetation, most damage tends to occurat low use levels. An example is the relationship betweenthe amount of trampling and soil compaction. The firstwalkers to use a piece of terrain will compact most of thesoil, and additional use will have proportionally lessimpact on the area. A similar relationship exists with veg-etation impacts initial light trampling can lead to high lev-els of damage, with relatively minor change thereafter. Two main impact factors are resistance and resilience.", "tokens": 390}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_39", "original_index": 39, "content": "Resistance is the ability to absorb use without being dis-turbed, and resilience is the ability to return to an undis-turbed state after a disturbance. In practical terms, resistance is a measure of the ability of different environ- ments and different cultures to resist change. Sherpas inNepal have been able to absorb the presence of touristswhile maintaining their culture for several generations,whereas the hill tribes in northern Thailand have seen pro-gressively greater cultural change affecting their core fam-ily structure. At natural sites, fertile soils are better able towithstand use and maintain vegetation thin soils have lit-tle chance to withstand heavy use. Lichens are consis-tently found to have low resistance to trampling. Coralcommunities in windward reef crest zones, which with-stand the pounding of ocean surf, are more resistant todamage caused by divers than coral communities in moreprotected flat zones. Resilience can also vary. The recovery rates of damaged vegetation depend on the fragility of a given ecosystem.Species of coral vary in the time it takes for them to recov-er after being damaged. Communities and the peoplewithin them adjust their life styles at different paces toaccommodate visitors. They may also readjust their use ofnatural resources if these resources become restrictedwhen an area goes under protection. 3.2 Environmental impacts common pat- terns and factors 3.2.1 Vegetation impacts vary with type of use and botanical differences in structure. Resistant plants include the grasses and sedges. Plants susceptible to tram-pling impacts include those with slow growth rates,thorns and prickles, flexible stems and leaves, and smallthick leaves that fold under pressure. Plant species foundin open grassy habitats are generally more tolerant oftrampling, while forest floor plants are less resistant. 3.2.2 Impacts on soil usually involve compaction and erosion.", "tokens": 389}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_40", "original_index": 40, "content": "Tourism often leads to soil compaction, usu- ally an unavoidable aspect of recreation activities.Compaction packs soil particles together and reducespore space, leading to a reduction in aeration and waterinfiltration. This increases water runoff from rain andmelting snow, causing reduced water absorption, a loss ofvegetation cover and erosion. Soil compaction, whileunavoidable, can be limited to certain areas. Erosion, onthe other hand, is more serious and tends to spread. Soils most prone to compaction are fine-textured homo- geneous soils such as clay and silt. Wet soils are moreprone to compaction and more readily churned. Meadowsoil and vegetation can be rapidly disturbed when tram-pled during rainy periods, increasing erosion and loweringthe water table. 3.2.3 Water impacts are associated with pathogens, organic waste and turbidity. Water turbidity from soil erosion is a frequent result of tourism infrastructure andrecreation. Where soils are more prone to erosion, tourist activities and development are more likely to alter waterquality to the detriment of aquatic flora and fauna.3WH  manual1-ch3 311002 1444 Page 2 Tourism Impacts and Problems 31Among water pollutants, pathogens are the most danger- ous. Common examples are faecal coliforms human andfaecal streptococci animal. High faecal counts are associ-ated with a lack of or malfunctioning of sewage and septic tank systems in hotels, and run-off from touristenclaves. Organic waste such as raw or insufficiently treat-ed sewage also affects water quality by encouraging algaeand weeds. These plants can wash up on shorelines, thendecay and form a breeding ground for insects. In general, chemical contamination is most severe in shal- low water sheltered from wind, especially in areas such asmarinas. Lakes and streams at lower elevations tend to beless vulnerable to alteration than alpine lakes. 3.2.4 Disturbances caused by tourists viewing wildlife affect some species more than others.", "tokens": 425}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_41", "original_index": 41, "content": "Some species habituate, that is, after the initial impact, whichmay be serious, they develop a tolerance for disturbance.Habituation is often mistakenly seen as positive because itbrings visitors closer to the wildlife. Tour operators some-times put food out to attract animals to places where vis-itors can see them. Attraction can be a negative response,however habituated wildlife may become aggressivewhile begging for food, and can injure and even kill theunwary visitor. Wildlife responses are variable, even within a single species or population. For example, some animals can tol-erate occasional disturbances but not frequent distur-bances. Nesting birds may tolerate the first fewencounters with humans, but once their level of toleranceis exceeded they may abandon their nests. Some animalsdevelop a tolerance for predictable disturbances, noisefrom passing cars for example, but cannot tolerate ran-dom disturbances. Larger game species tend to be moreaffected by direct contact with people, while smallerwildlife are more susceptible to indirect impacts on theirhabitat. More timid and sensitive species of animalsbecome permanently displaced from recreation areaswhen confronted by humans, while other animals such asdeer become habituated over time. Some animals frighten more easily than others, a factor that affects feeding and reproductive patterns. Maine tur-tles and some bird species in the Galapagos National Parkwithdraw from habitats visited by tourists and move toother places less suitable for survival and reproduction.Deer, which like other ungulates are relatively unafraid ofhumans, often graze along roadsides.

Where touristsexceeded a certain minimal distance, about half the rhi-nos abandoned the best quality pasture and took shelterin less nourishing dense vegetation. Researchers think thissituation may affect the genetic makeup of the rhino,favouring the reproduction of tame animals over timidones. 3.3 Common impacts related to visitor use 3.3.1 Visitors exhibit predictable patterns. People tend to travel along established routes and be attracted tocertain locations. Consequently, impacts are usually con-fined to these areas. However, tourism areas tend toexpand over time. A related phenomenon is that once anarea is opened to tourism and recreation, impacts willoccur rapidly. Overall, environmental impacts have a ten-dency to be curvilinear see Chapter 6. 3.3.2 Group size plays a role in the development of impacts. Large parties tend to expand the areas they visit. This has management ramifications for groups such asmountaineering expeditions where large parties can cre-ate small cities during the length of their stay. Large par-ties also can create a heavy amount of use in a short time.As a result, large parties are of particular concern in pris-tine natural areas and at delicate cultural sites. At culturalsites large parties can cause bottlenecks at an interpreta-tive display. At monuments they can overwhelm certainexhibitions, blocking the view of smaller groups or indi-viduals. Large groups can block the flow of visitor traffic,for example, through a cathedral.", "tokens": 433}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_43", "original_index": 43, "content": "There are exceptions to this pattern. Along a trail or cathe- dral walkway, for example, large parties probably have nomore impact than small parties as long as they remain onthe trail or walkway. With wildlife, large parties may haveless impact than several small parties if the frequency ofdisturbance is a factor, as in the situation with manyspecies of birds. 3.3.3 Various activities are associated with certain types of impacts. For example, rock climbing and nature photography can disturb nesting birds. Scuba diving andcruising can cause damage to coral reefs. Horseback rid-ing, hiking and camping cause vegetation and soil distur-bance. Visitors to monuments can cause abrasion throughtouching. Activities involving motor vehicles have negative impacts on many fragile environments. Noisy motorboats andwater scooters disrupt the feeding and breeding patternsof birds, and can injure other aquatic wildlife. Motorboatpropellers repeatedly kill and maim docile freshwater3WH  manual1-ch3 311002 1444 Page 3 Tourism Impacts and Problems 32manatees. Motorboats are also highly polluting one powerboat emits 70 times more hydrocarbons than anaverage car does. Beach vehicles disrupt the accumulationof seaweed that provides mulch for colonising dune veg-etation. Soil compacted by vehicles in the Mojave Desertin the United States would need about a century to berestored. Because of these impacts, managers often rec- ommend banning motorised vehicles from fragile areassuch as sand dunes and deserts. Impacts vary according to how tourists practise different activities. Well-trained divers with good buoyancy controlare less likely to damage coral than inexperienced divers.Mountaineers trained in low-impact camping cause farless damage than those without such training. Some con-scientious tour operators adopt certain viewing policies tolimit impacts on wildlife.", "tokens": 390}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_44", "original_index": 44, "content": "Many operators of whale-watch-ing tours have their drivers maintain set distances fromthe whales, avoid chasing the animals, and switch off theboat engines during close-up viewing so as not to pro-duce undue stress. At a cultural site, for example a sacredrock art site or a church, visitors can be asked to show respect by covering their heads or maintaining silence. Impacts caused by tourists are usually unintentional andcan frequently be reduced through sensitivity training. 3.3.4 Crowding is a negative impact when it inter- feres with tourists expectations. Early research found that increases in visitor numbers led to decreases in satis-faction levels. As a result, managers sought to determinethe point at which visitation numbers would cause a feel-ing of crowding. However, it turns out that the relation-ship between numbers of people and visitor satisfaction ismore complicated. While large numbers of people at asite can certainly decrease aesthetic enjoyment and dimin-ish opportunities for solitude, sheer numbers do not nec-essarily diminish visitor satisfaction. Instead, negativereactions tend to occur when tourists feel that fellow vis- itors are interfering with their desired experience. A fur-ther complication is that the negative effects of crowdingvary with the characteristics of different visitors, theirexperience with the area, fellow visitors behaviour, andthe characteristics and peculiarities of the setting. Forexample, people viewing wildlife in Maasai Mara, a naturereserve, may be annoyed by the presence of only a few other vehicles, while at a game park other vehicles aremore expected. Visitors may also change their expecta-tions associated with an activity in order to toleratecrowded conditions.The Classic Community Tourism Cycle  Stage 1 Communities build small bungalows for local tourism. Residential houses are renovated and convert-ed into small hotels and boarding lodges, earning rev-enue for local people.

Local people still benefiteconomically, although the bulk of the income goes toa small number of people. Stage 3 Hotel construction begins at a faster rate, planning regulations are ignored, and building pro-ceeds haphazardly, causing degradation of the environ-ment. Local people benefit as employees in the localhotels and lodges and in the transport sector. Stage 4 Most hotel, bungalow and restaurant owners are from outside the local community. Money begins toflow out. Large developments are implemented withoutregard for regulations. Large hotels and organisationspromote international tourism, and profits stay in thecountry of origin. Tourists contribute small amounts ofmoney by buying souvenirs. Water supplies and theenvironment become endangered and developers fearfor the future. Local residents may begin to resenttourists. Stage 5 Degradation of the environment sparks fears of a decrease in the volume of tourism and promptscalls for action. Remedial action is slow to take effect,and the degradation continues. The local communityhas benefited all along, but control has been takenover by outside developers, who may decide to aban-don the area and move somewhere else. 3.4 Tourism impacts on communities and culture 3.4.1. Models fail to capture the complexity of the tourism cycle because they assume a homogeneouscommunity, a rarity in real life. For example, in the later stages of the tourism cycle, models fail to showwhether the whole community is hostile to tourism orwhether only certain sections of the population sufferfrom and complain about the social impacts. The fact thathost community members adapt to tourism in variousways adds complexity to the problem. Another factor isthat tourism growth may occur alongside other changes,and the hosts behaviour may be a response to thesechanges more than to the changes brought by tourism.", "tokens": 386}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_46", "original_index": 46, "content": "Also, while many studies have investigated general atti- tudes towards tourism in particular communities, fewhave looked into attitudes towards specific communitytourism products and services. A major research problemhas been that few studies have been designed on theadvice of those being affected. Only a few researchershave asked respondents to rate or assess the importanceof impacts cited by local people.3WH  manual1-ch3 311002 1444 Page 4 Tourism Impacts and Problems 33How Local Communities Can Lose Out on the Benefits of Tourism  Tourism may not attract sufficient visitors quickly enough to generate the quantities of revenue needed tomeet the economic expectations of the community. Thisresults from the competitive nature of tourism or thequality of resources in the communities. The inability tomeet community expectations can lead to disenchant-ment with the programme and the belief that the siteserves no useful purpose with the community, which is inturn less likely to engage in protection activities. Tourism can increase burdens on local populations with-out producing mitigating benefits. Tourism revenues oftenreach a different segment of the population than thosewho must bear the burden of diminishing resources. Most tourist spending  airfares, hotel and tour opera-tors fees  benefits foreign companies. Locals may live in scattered small groups or villages andcommunication may be difficult, limiting fair distributionof economic revenues. Developers may deprive locals of anticipated economicbenefits, or local power relations may dictate who willbenefit from tourism opportunities. For example, well-connected individuals may monopolise opportunities toserve as guides or provide transport for visitors. Start-up credit may be difficult to obtain. A study inBelize showed that while local investors had extreme diffi-culty obtaining credit to start tourism businesses, thesame banks offered credit if the same investors enteredinto partnerships with foreign firms.", "tokens": 363}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_47", "original_index": 47, "content": "Not all tourism activities have equal potential for com-munity involvement. Some more sophisticated activitiesneed specific training before a community can beinvolved. For example, small community-run hotel projectsmay be hampered by administrative and organisationalproblems resulting from a lack of business skills. InMexico, a cooperatively owned and run hotel projectfailed because cooperative members lacked training in thenecessary administrative skills to effectively run the busi-ness. In many cases providing opportunities for guiding inspecialised activities such as bird-watching or river raftingis not feasible. Ground operators prefer skilled, well-edu-cated guides from the capital city who speak English orother European languages. Tour companies and hotels, as a general policy, do notuse local guides. In attempts to rectify the situation insome countries, tour operators and hotels are required tohire under-skilled local guides under government rules orregulations or sometimes in the form of a protected areapolicy. Because these countries often have few competentlocal guides, tour operators resent being required to usethem, often seeing them as an additional financial drain. Because rural tourism is often seasonal, it tends not tocreate permanent employment. But the temporary jobs itoffers may compete with other seasonal jobs such as agri-cultural work, leaving no net gain for the community.3.4.2 Interaction between tourism development and a community has been shown to be difficult to pre-dict, with few consistent relationships or patterns.Following is an overview of findings on this complicatedissue. High tourism concentrations can be viewed as pos-itive by some communities and negative by others. Whilenegative attitudes are usually associated with high levelsof development, some communities support tourismdespite high resident-to-tourist ratios. Visitation to SharkBay, Western Australia, grew from 10,000 in 1984 to150,000 in 1990, boosting the resident-to-visitor ratiofrom 110 to 1150 in just six years.", "tokens": 397}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_48", "original_index": 48, "content": "Despite the rapidgrowth rate and the emergence of serious environmentalproblems, residents remain positive about tourism andsupport its continued growth. Similarly, at Nadi, Fiji, wheretourism development and contact with tourists is alsohigh, the hosts remain positive in their reactions andattitudes. Some studies have found that residents are more likely to support tourism if they stand to benefit from it throughemployment for themselves or family members. Or theybelieve the benefits of tourism outweigh the negativeimpacts. Some studies show that people who do not benefit from tourism support the industry regardless. Some research has reported local concern over the impact of tourism development on property prices, access torecreation, traffic congestion, quality of life, salaries and higher prices. Other research shows little relationshipbetween tourism development and indicators such as thequality of life. Residents in the Austrian Alps reported thatwhile tourism had brought higher prices for basic necessi-ties, higher taxes and competition over the distribution ofbenefits, as well as decreased participation in communityprojects, the overall influence of tourism on the commu-nities was positive. 3.4.3 Some cultures can adapt positively to external influences while others cannot. Cultures and commu- nities with a history of interacting with other cultures anda gradual exposure to outside groups incorporate newpractices into their lives, safeguard their own cultures, andhave fewer difficulties with tourism. Groups that have hadlittle contact with outsiders have greater difficulty. Anextreme case is when Australian aborigines paid absolute-ly no attention to Captain Cooks ship the Endeavor in1770, finding it unclassifiable and too bizarre to contendwith.

While in some cases tourists interest in localart, music and language may foster a cultural renaissance,3WH  manual1-ch3 311002 1444 Page 5 Tourism Impacts and Problems 34most often researchers report traditional cultures veering towards commodification. 3.4.4 Cultural commodification is the erosion of cul- tural practices until they become meaningless. In a tourism setting this develops as people and their culturalsymbols are treated as commodities that can be bought,changed or sold. As this occurs people begin to performexclusively for the tourists benefit, and events may losetheir value as a cultural and spiritual manifestation. Asa defensive mechanism some communities try to limittourists intrusion by keeping separate cultural manifesta-tions closed to tourists, and offering staged authenticityperformances to visitors, including appropriate interpreta-tion and explanations. 3.4.5 Community acceptance of tourism depends greatly on the extent to which the attraction reflectsthe needs and desires of local people and their inte-gration into the industry. Negative cultural change can be minimised if local people are able to participate intourist-related businesses and have a role in making deci-sions about the numbers and types of tourists enteringtheir communities, and at what frequency. Cultural andeconomic impacts are reduced where local groups havehad some autonomy over their land, where they havebeen integrated into the tourism industry. Access for locals to an attraction, and the perception that the attraction brings economic benefits through the cre-ation of jobs or additional income into the local economyare other factors contributing to community acceptance.Free access for locals is often seen as a positive develop-ment.

In neighbour-ing villages some 70 percent of the population live off theland, making about one-third of what the locals in themain settlement make. Tourism has created social ten-sions as locals resent higher boat fares and rising costs ofeveryday goods conflicts arise over the use of parkresources such as fish, fruit and rattan and illegal hunting and fishing are on the increase. 3.4.7 Distributing economic benefits to support local populations has been difficult for a number of rea-sons. In a study of protected areas with tourism pro- grammes, few generated substantial benefits for localpeople. Even in highly successful areas, few direct benefitswent to local communities. For example, whiletourists generate about 5 million annually at Khao YaiNational Park in Thailand, little of the revenue benefits thesurrounding communities. Tourism development in the Everest area of Nepal tends to be concentrated alongstrips, with little room for economic benefits to spread.Studies in some areas of Nepal showed that only the vil-lage elite were able to capture tourism benefits. 3.4.8 Economic development from tourism does not readily translate into community participation in conservation and protection actions. The reasons for this include the following  Economic benefits from tourism often create insufficient incentives for local communities to support conservationand protection. Strategies for creating ownership of an economic devel- opment conservation programme are difficult to devel-op. Often, no mechanisms exist for providing incentivesfor conservation activities.", "tokens": 369}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_51", "original_index": 51, "content": "Donors will often provideinfrastructure, schools, clinics, wells, etc., in areas out-side protected zones without consulting or engaginglocal communities. Since these initiatives are seen asgrants, people feel little responsibility for their futuremaintenance. Clearly they are unsustainable. The link between tourism benefits and conservation activities may be unclear or nonexistent. For tourism topromote conservation, local people must benefit eco-nomically and see a clear link between the benefits andthe need to protect the resource. If benefits do not stayin local areas or are narrowly distributed, there is littlechance of making these important links. A study ofCosta Rican and Mexican nature guides revealed thateven though the guides were trained in ecology, no def-inite relationship was seen between their training andtheir participation in community conservation efforts.The study concluded that guides with demonstratedprior interest and experience in community conservationactivities should be identified and recruited.

Resistanceand resilience factors may be described in backgroundinformation collected during the planning process, forexample concerning the vulnerability of certain wildlifespecies. Evaluating a sites goals and objectives when deciding on the degree to which impacts should be controlled willinfluence tourism activities. For example, habituation maymake it easier for tourists to see wildlife but seriouslycompromise scientific study. If scientific investigation is amanagement objective, maintaining populations ofwildlife in a natural state will take precedence overtourism considerations. Impacts that are visitor related should be analysed according to use patterns, types of user groups, groupsize, amount of use and mode of travel. Through suchanalysis, visitor groups and activities can be matched withproblem areas. A communitys stability and structure have an important effect on its resilience. Essential factors to analyse includethe communitys ability to plan and its labour patterns,i.e., who is employed, in what capacity at what wagesand during which months.

Tourism-related public participationissues form the basis of a checklist for managers whowish to avoid unnecessary conflicts. Knowledge ofthese issues is an essential prerequisite for effectivepublic participation, particularly when planningstakeholder meetings and setting up tourism advisory councils. 4.1 Why involve stakeholders in planning and management? 4.1.1 Involving stakeholders saves time and money.

Examples abound of proj- ects that were blocked because of a lack of effective com-munication with stakeholders. Construction of a culturalcentre on the South Pacific Island of Truk was blockedbecause the project officer failed to consult with the gov-ernor. Had he done so he would have discovered a con-flict between the governor and a local leader in the villagewhere the project was planned. Early attempts at ecosys-tem management in Yellowstone National Park in theUnited States were delayed because management startedformulating an overall regional plan before unifying thekey stakeholders. Learning from past problems, many sites now invest a considerable amount of time in meetings with key stake-holder groups, asking them to articulate their views anddefining issues to be examined together. Through suchdialogue and collaboration, site management becomesfamiliar with the various stakeholder positions regardingtourism issues and activities that could have an impact onthe site. 4.1.3 Stakeholders can inform managers about easi- ly misunderstood local cultural differences. Religious or cultural values are often of primary importance to com-munities and can go unnoticed if locals are not involved inthe planning and management process. For example,while site staff may legitimately regard certain valleys,rock formations or archaeological sites as natural or anthropological resources, such sites may be sacred to thehost communities. Fencing, boardwalks and other struc-tures built in such areas may be offensive to the local peo-ple and compromise the sites cultural value.

For example, Participatory Rural AppraisalsPRAs carried out in Ucchali, a site in Pakistan that is clas-sified as a protected wetland and is managed as a water-fowl sanctuary, revealed a mismatch between local viewsand experts perceptions. Experts assumed that the areaslakes were longstanding geographical features. The vil-lagers knew that increased rains had formed the lakesover the previous 50 years, and that the water had sub-merged prime agricultural land that had been owned bythe local villages for centuries. Local communities believedthat their land rights were neglected when projects wentahead to conserve the wetland. Another pitfall occurs when experts views are oriented towards narrow interests. In the wetland project inPakistan, scientists tended to focus on species of specialconcern for international conservation and the wetlandhabitat. The villagers had a wider view of the ecosystemthat made the connection between the forests, the water-shed, the areas land use history and their livelihoods.Also, complex phenomena such as birds migratory pat-terns, changes in water quality, sedimentation rates andgroundwater levels were locally monitored and wellunderstood.

As community involvement increased,local businessmen and government leaders looked moreand more to tourism to help generate economic develop-ment opportunities and to help pay for restorationefforts. With this in mind they formed the Patan TourismDevelopment Organisation to help attract tourists to thecommunity. 4.2.2 Open discussion may be seen as a threat to ones power and control. Some stakeholders are unwill- ing to support wider participation, especially when it isseen as a threat to their authority. For example, managersmay accept a policy of openness and communication butmay resist supplying all pertinent information to interestgroups. This situation eventually creates a climate of dis-trust, limiting the site managers ability to deal with thepublic. 4.2.3 The most vocal critics can dominate the partic- ipation process. Many citizens view public participation as a means of influencing policies and decisions. Publichearings can become forums in which the most vocal crit-ics of a plan can dominate discussions and exclude othersfrom the process. This can happen if an organised lobbygroup is heavily represented. Some people with legitimateconcerns may be intimidated by a venue such as a meet- ing hall and be afraid to speak up. Alternative venues suchas community centres can facilitate a more comfortableexchange of ideas and encourage balanced communica-tion among stakeholders. 4.2.4 Large numbers of people may be overlooked because they are not as vocal as other groups. Any issue that generates public interest is subject to a widerange of opinion. While most people will have an opinion,many will not feel strongly about the issue. This largemajority risks being ignored.", "tokens": 364}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_60", "original_index": 60, "content": "It may be felt that they arethe group that can be most influenced because they arenot very interested and are probably not well informed.The possibility of some event igniting the interest of thisless-interested majority should however not be underesti-mated. Consideration of these groups is essential toensuring long-term public support. 4.2.5 Hierarchical structures may inhibit stakeholder participation in decision making. In many societies the formal structure of institutions and organisations as wellas cultural norms may make it difficult to elicit the opin-ions of certain groups making stakeholder participation informal meetings impossible. A few powerful agenciesmay dominate, overwhelming other stakeholders andblocking cooperation. In some countries, the governmentis directly involved in the actual business of tourism, func-tioning as tour operators as well as making policy, whichmay lead to imbalances in stakeholder input. 4.2.6 Public participation may be more a form of appeasement than a way to solicit stakeholdersinput. Offering local communities the opportunity to par- ticipate raises expectations about acceptance of their sug-gestions. A government may try to guide a particularchoice either by representing only one opinion or by pro-posing a set of choices among which only one is tenable.Decisions may have already been made before public par-ticipation begins any changes may be minor with rela-tively small impacts. Before embarking on a participatoryplanning exercise, proponents have to be ready to changeoriginal plans according to the input received. 4.2.7 Overemphasis on involving stakeholder groups can lead to a failure to recognise certain effects onresources. Managers must understand how stakeholders perceive impacts and define acceptability. However, manystakeholder groups have limited knowledge about naturaland cultural resources and may be unaware of potentialnegative impacts.", "tokens": 365}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_61", "original_index": 61, "content": "Visitors adapt to deteriorating environ-mental conditions, accepting degradation as theinevitable result of increasing visitation.

So, while public participation is nec-essary, over-reliance on public input can lead to inactionand a deterioration of conditions over time. With resourceInvolving Stakeholders The Benefits and Challenges of Public Participation 4WH  manual1-ch4 311002 1455 Page 3 40bases declining and the demand for recreation and tourist attractions on the rise, it is managers who must ultimate-ly decide the parameters of how much and what kinds oftourism activity are acceptable. 4.3 Factors promoting participation and effective communication 4.3.1 Trust enhances a groups willingness to partici- pate. Trust is the crucial element of successful public par- ticipation. Building trust and a willingness to participatedepends on several factors. Positive earlier interaction builds trust. The history of the experiences with, for example, a state government agencyinfluences the chances of fostering participation.Rebuilding relations between conservation authorities andlocal people after a history of policing and exclusion canbe difficult. H.S. Panwar, who taught at the WildlifeInstitute of India at Dehra Dun, reported that the main cri-teria of success in ecologically oriented development proj-ects were building trust and enrolling the full participationof local people in the planning and implementationprocess. Honouring commitments builds trust. Amboseli National Park in Kenya, La Amistad National Park in Costa Rica andPanama, and Yellowstone National Park in the UnitedStates have all had problems with local communities afterfunding cuts that forced policy changes.", "tokens": 380}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_62", "original_index": 62, "content": "At Amboseli, alack of funding for maintaining pumps at watering facili-ties caused a gap in trust with park officials and impingedon the needs of local Maasai cattle herders. At La Amistadand Yellowstone, personnel and budget cuts took a finan-cial toll on the local communities. Gestures that show equality, for example, sharing infor- mation equally among stakeholders, promote trust. Fromits inception, the Great Barrier Reef project worked froma scientific information base, regularly issuing maps, dataand carefully prepared information to the public. Time is necessary to build trust. Many experts agree that more time and effort could be spent addressing the vari-ous agendas of interest groups. One researcher writes,Trust-building takes time. The history of rural develop-ment initiatives is littered with enough examples to indi-cate that such time is a resource well spent in terms ofeffective policy outcomes. A non-partisan image helps build trust with stakeholders. When a particular problem arises at a site, the site man-ager -- who is seen as a government official -- may bewise to ask a popular local personality to explain the mat-ter to the public. If time and money permit, credible sci-entific information can serve as non-partisan evidence toheighten public understanding of an issue and changepeoples minds. Yellowstone officials published pertinentscientific information, viewed as more neutral, in the dailynewspaper to advise the public about a project to reintro- duce wolves into the park. 4.3.2 A collective approach encourages public partic- ipation. A process calling for participation and collabora- tion has been found to be more conducive to consensusthan traditional methods involving expert planners only.Work in community extension projects has shown more progress in community relations when participatory meth-ods are used. Experts report that no point is too early inthe project cycle to begin inviting local participation.", "tokens": 395}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_63", "original_index": 63, "content": "A participatory approach is beneficial in several ways While issues of power and control will not disappear cer- tain individuals will always be motivated to convert othersto their position the participatory process enhances com-munication by showing both the common ground and thedifferences between the stakeholder groups. The exerciseoften leads to compromise and a breakdown of defensivepositions. Consensus-Building The literature on mediation suggests that conflicts are best resolved when people who are not technically fluentin the issues nevertheless guide decision making.Sometimes stakeholders present technical arguments toboost their positions, which is when the mediator shouldseek agreement on the technical issues before developingpolicy options. Mixed sessions involving technical andnon-technical participants should be led by a mediatorwho can control the technical language and seek clarifica-tion on behalf of all participants. Mediation is a process in which a neutral person or per- sons who are not a party to a dispute help people settletheir differences through negotiation. It is a subtleprocess that can potentially backfire, during which media-tors try to separate positions from interests and avoid theperception of favouring one party over another. Collaboration is of key importance in building trust among stakeholders. Studies have shown that peoplewho participate in group decisions are more likely toimplement them. One expert describes consensus as fol-lows We all can live with X as a solution to a problemand we all agree to going along with whatever X requiresus to do.", "tokens": 288}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_64", "original_index": 64, "content": "Basic tips for obtaining consensus include  Being frank and honest when expressing ideas  Avoiding judging ideas too quickly Being willing to compromise Examining decisions and problems systematically Agreeing at the outset what issue is being addressed, and your goal.Involving Stakeholders The Benefits and Challenges of Public Participation4WH  manual1-ch4 311002 1455 Page 4 41One of the best-known and most useful consensus-build- ing techniques is brainstorming followed by filtering seebelow. The technique involves six steps  Preparing for the session  Determining the brainstorming method to use Generating ideas Creating filters Applying filters Wrapping up the session Brainstorming involves two basic methods, freewheeling and round robin. With freewheeling, groups sponta-neously present and share ideas, which are duly recordedby a facilitator. The round-robin method is more struc-tured, with the facilitator asking group members for spe-cific ideas on the issue being discussed. This method isused more with reticent groups. Brainstorming seeks to generate as many ideas as possible. The exercise can end when  Everyone has had a chance to participate No more ideas are offered A last call for ideas has been made and Team members have been thanked for their input andtime. Once ideas are generated, filters criteria set by the group, such as cost and time constraints are created to screenthem. Participants will readily help identify filtering crite-ria, such as cost, time factors, availability of the necessaryresources, philosophical considerations, and acceptabilityto management and other stakeholders. The filters allow the facilitator to go through the list of ideas and cross off those that do not qualify. The final step in the process is to review the ideas that survived the filtering process, and define each of theseideas to make sure all team members agree. The groupshould also delegate a member to relate the informationto other groups or other stakeholders.", "tokens": 392}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_65", "original_index": 65, "content": "Evidence suggests that people are reluctant to divulge past difficulties. Informal communication systems such assurveys can help get people to reveal their interests andconcerns. Reports from the North Pennines TourismPartnership programme in England revealed that suchinformal communication helped to resolve issues betweenthe different groups. Public involvement tends to build momentum towards collaborative implementation. As one researcher haspointed out, misunderstandings between groups, ratherthan a lack of information, is at the core of many socialdifficulties.4.4 Effective collaboration and communi- cation techniques 4.4.1 Participatory techniques such as rural appraisals allow local people to describe their envi-ronment. Participatory Rural Appraisals PRAs can facili- tate the exchange of informal information between localgovernment officials, NGO staff and local people. Thesemethods have proven capable of overcoming the prob-lems of listening and shaping an accurate assessment ofstakeholder concerns. The techniques help map out localresources, ways people make a living, trends in resource use, and the local costs and benefits of conservation andprotection. They are practical methods of encouraginglocal participation, fostering communication and makinga more accurate appraisal of local concerns. The utility ofthese methods has been demonstrated in many areas ofthe world, particularly in Pakistan and India. Participatorytechniques, including PRAs, can be used for both naturaland cultural sites. Participatory Environmental Mapping Technique The Participatory Environmental Mapping Technique lies at the heart of Participatory Rural Appraisals. The tech-nique involves asking local people to draw maps on theground. The exercise starts with an open-ended question,such as, Can you draw a map of your village?", "tokens": 350}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_66", "original_index": 66, "content": "Usinglocal materials such as sticks, stones, grass, wood and cig-arette packets, or coloured chalk provided by the projectofficer, participants map out the village, often promptingdiscussion over the accuracy of the drawing. Since theprocess is participatory, and all the information is con-stantly visible to all participants, the technique avoids thepitfalls of the typical interview, in which someone maydominate the discussion. The mapping should be carried out in a low-key, relaxed atmosphere. The project officer may start off the mapwith a simple, obvious feature such as the main road orriver, or the next village, and then hand over the stick to alocal person to continue the map. This hand-over is oftenseen as an important symbolic action. Once participantsagree on the map, more open-ended questions stimulatefurther discussion. For example, Is the whole area thesame or are there differences? What else is importantto show on the map? Have I forgotten anything?Open-ended questions assure neutrality. Participants areasked to add their responses to the map. The project offi-cer should ask permission to copy the map into a note-book, explaining why and discussing the follow-up.Another technique is to distribute automatic cameras tocommunity members, explaining its use, and ask them tophotograph, over a couple of days, features and land-scapes they believe may be of interest to visitors a com-munity-based inventory of attractions. Kayapoamerindians in Brazil have used this process successfully. Involving Stakeholders The Benefits and Challenges of Public Participation 4WH  manual1-ch4 311002 1455 Page 5 42To improve data, different PRA methods are used and then compared with each other and against additionalinformation from villagers. Community specialists recom-mend that such information should always be comple-mented with other methods such as transect walks of thecommunity enabling a specialist to verify mapping accom-panied by locals.", "tokens": 398}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_67", "original_index": 67, "content": "Comparison with scientific maps or pho-tos, participation in daily activities, and farmer-to-farmervisits are also recommended. Planning under any circumstances should be carried out slowly. Any work, however benign or well meaning,which appears to threaten local power structures will bechallenged. 4.4.2 Alternative forms of dialogue can help limit public confrontations. Public meetings can be ineffec- tive when the parties with the most vested interestsattend with the goal of pressing their particular causes.Less confrontational meeting structures can reduce suchundue influence and limit the posturing of interest groupsfor the press. During the controversial Yellowstone wolfreintroduction project, open houses were held where indi- vidual people could sit down in a relaxed atmosphere andtalk directly with representatives of the various agenciesinvolved. Special meetings were held to allow powerful interest groups to voice their opinions, but they were lis-tening sessions only. These were run by female park offi-cials, perceived as less threatening and non-partisan thanmale officials, and local police were hired to maintain order. Effective Meetings Meetings take up much of a site managers time. They are an important nearly daily way of forming relationshipswith stakeholder groups including foreign donors andtourism officials. An interactive method of running meet-ings entails agreement on how the meeting will go aboutsolving problems. Many management problems stem from the fact that people have difficulty listening and hearing what some-one else is really saying. While listening seems to be asimple and obvious skill, specialists say few people areeffective listeners. However, listening skills can be learned. The following are five ingredients of an effective meeting  A clearly defined and agreed role and responsibility for each participant.", "tokens": 348}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_68", "original_index": 68, "content": "A common focus on content A common focus on process A person responsible for maintaining an open and balanced conversational flow  A person responsible for protecting individuals from personal attackA meeting agenda should be sent to participants before- hand so they can prepare. Meetings should be planned to avoid the group attack syndrome, in which group members feel they will beattacked as soon as they speak. The key to resolvingproblems of authority and power is to use a facilitatorwhose role is to hold the group together, offer sugges-tions and wait for agreement on any particular issue. Thefacilitator keeps the group on track, ensuring that no onedominates the discussions. The facilitator must remainneutral, refraining from contributing ideas or judging theideas of others. The facilitator, the minute-taker and allother key participants should explain their roles at theoutset of a meeting. Meetings must be recorded, and minutes should be dis- tributed to the participants ahead of the following meet-ing. The recorder should avoid interpreting theproceedings without input from participants, and try toremain objective. Recording ideas without identifyingtheir source builds trust in the system and helps thegroup to accept ideas. During the meeting, flipcharts canbe used to provide an immediate record of what is said. 4.4.3 The process of developing a management plan can encourage the participation of stakeholders. The process can also be used to build consensus. However,instead of releasing draft management plans for publiccomment, planners should begin by identifying what isneeded from the public, and what a site can offer them inreturn. Plans and strategies should be developed slowly, be dynamic and adaptable, and be concise rather thanlengthy. Above all, they should be inclusive of all stake-holders.", "tokens": 357}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_69", "original_index": 69, "content": "Examples of successful issue-based management planning include the great Smokey Mountains National Park in theUnited States, where many trails were in poor conditionand needed to be closed to have time to recover. Parkmanagers realised that closing trails would generate neg-ative sentiment. To educate the public about the situation,management decided to involve people in the process.Meetings were held to give people an understanding ofthe parks mission and to provide them with an opportu-nity to participate in setting priorities. At the Willandra Lakes Region World Heritage site, in Australia, a five-day workshop was held at which com-munity members helped write the first draft of a man-agement plan. The exercise guaranteed continuedsupport for the plan.

The Nominal Group Technique The nominal group technique NGT has proven valuable in visitor management. It involves forming discussiongroups of eight to 10 people of different backgrounds.Participants are asked to draw up lists of key concernsabout a project without consulting other group members.Using a round-robin procedure, participants itemise theirconcerns and then vote on their priorities. The technique has several advantages. The time taken to itemise concerns encourages thinking on the part of theparticipants. The format encourages full group participa-tion by preventing assertive people from dominating, as iscommon with focus groups. A three-stage approach for community tourism planning can be used. First, key community leaders are inter-viewed. Using the issues identified, a random sample ofcommunity members can be surveyed. Finally a nominalgroup and a focus group can be used to determine thecommunitys preferences concerning tourism. The NGT is useful for dealing with sensitive and contro- versial or prominent issues, when conflicting opinions andcomplex details may impede dialogue. Using the NGT, thefirst round is silent, giving people a chance to enter theirideas without having to speak. The NGT also gives peoplean equal opportunity to speak regardless of social statusor personality.

At this stage in the process the ideas are not dis-cussed. Items are not duplicated, and if any ideas arecombined, the facilitator and recorder make sure thateveryone in the group agrees on the arrangement. Eachlisted item is discussed to clarify its meaning. The groupfacilitator assigns a letter to each of the ideas. Then eachteam member, using his or her own list, ranks the ideas. The group may decide to rank only the top five ideas. Longer lists may be reduced using the half plus one rulei.e., 30 items would be cut to 16. To tally the results,each participant calls out his or her rankings. The recorderlists the results. The top-ranked items represent theteams decision up to that point, before any discussion ofthe merits of the ideas. An open discussion is held to determine whether the decision is consistent with everyones thinking, and toconsider items that may have received too few or toomany votes. If things seem really inconsistent anothervote can take place. After this step people can be taskedwith the next steps in a plan for implementation oraction. At Tangariro National Park in New Zealand, a Maori burial site became a popular rock-climbing area. Because thisuse of the site was of great concern to the Maori, meet-ings were held between the climbers and tribal elders withthe result that the climbers agreed to practise voluntaryrestraint in using the area. 4.4.5 Local NGOs can serve as a liaison for more effective and sustained participation.

In selecting or designing projects,sufficient time should be allowed for consensus-buildinginvolving local decision-making.

Experts who are not part of a local culture cannot always judge local perceptions, preferences or priorities, andshould not necessarily be expected to provide such infor-mation. The ideals of representation and responsiveness are reached differently in different contexts. Effective plan- ning is often hampered by a lack of understanding of thehard realities of the political and economic context.Compiling a complete list of stakeholders and the variousaffinities and conflicts within the interest groups can be auseful first step in analysing site issues. This evaluationshould be carried out with stakeholders including govern-ment agencies at all levels, conservation groups, develop-ers and local communities. Suggested Activities 1.Create a preliminary list of the sites stakeholders and their concerns. Sort stakeholders into categories, for example, tour operators, local businesses etc. Identify the concerns of the different groups. Develop a matrix showing where they overlap. 2.Develop a list of benefits and obstacles related to tourism planning and stakeholder interests. Review the sustainable tourism planning process develop goals, objectives and a monitoring programmeas described in this manual. Discuss the perceived obstacles and benefits to thisprocess for each of the identified stakeholder groupsdescribe how they will influence tourism planning. 3.Develop a public participation programme. Review past attempts to involve the groups and the lessons learned about public participation. Review each stakeholders role in the planningprocess. Hold a brainstorming session with staff to plan forpublic participation with reference to the lessonslearned and the information in this manual.

While policy goals are general, management objectives set out in detail how a site will be managed. Within theframework of the general policy goals, the objectives spellout desired conditions, reflecting what managementwants to maintain and the experiences a visitor would ide-ally encounter at a site. For example, if a policy goal is toprovide local employment opportunities, then a manage-ment objective may be to encourage the use of localguides. If a goal is to maintain a sacred site in a mannerensuring respect and tranquillity, then objectives mayinclude limiting visitation and noise levels. Objectives should be subject to evaluation. They should therefore be specific, quantifiable, have time limits and bestated in clear language so that they can be understoodby all those responsible for implementation. They shouldbe the basis for a standard by which to gauge the per-formance of site management. For example, at a histori-cal monument, a policy goal may be to support localeducational activities, while a management objectivecould be to increase the number of local schoolchildrenwho attend the sites educational programme.

Theytook the park authorities to court over charges of nepo-tism, and the park responded by pointing to its statedpolicy goal of supporting the rural poor.", "tokens": 376}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_78", "original_index": 78, "content": "Determining categories of visitors as a planning toolThe same park had a policy of encouraging Indian nation- als to visit as well as generating local economic benefits.It was determined to encourage the following categoriesof visitors  People from New Delhi and other states Local tourists from adjacent districts People from the nearest town and surrounding vil- lages and towns  Students from the immediate area and nearby towns Foreign tourists Serious bird-watchers who stay for a week or so Annual visitors from both within India and abroad Setting fees on the basis of goals and objectivesPolicy goals can guide the setting of entrance fees. In this case, the park authorities wanted to generate more rev-enue to support local development projects, but they hadto avoid maximising the fees, fearing that such a policymight lead to charges of elitism, conflict with their educa-tional objectives, and possibly a loss of local political sup-port. They opted for a multi-tiered policy, substantiallyraising the entrance fee for foreign visitors while reducingit for local visitors, and creating a weekly pass for seriousbird-watchers. To determine the new fees, they conduct-ed a willingness-to-pay survey. 5.2 Issues of cultural authenticity and natural integrity 5.2.1 The cultural authenticity andor natural integrity of a site must be considered when devel-oping tourism policy goals and objectives. If heritage becomes a commodity, serious questions may arise withrespect to these two issues. A tourism marketing process may fail to focus on a sites true cultural traditions or his-torical interpretation and instead package it using animagined sense of character. World Heritage cultural sites,many incapable of accommodating large volumes oftourists, may use inappropriate modern materials andstyles when trying to increase capacity. For example, theArchaeological Survey of India ruled out lighting thegrounds of the Taj Mahal.", "tokens": 364}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_79", "original_index": 79, "content": "Lights would have made it eas-ier for evening visitors but would have taken away fromthe experience of seeing the monument by moonlight. A historic town in the United States was practically desert- ed, raising the question of whether to let the culturalresource continue its natural decline or intervene to restore the site for more intensive tourism. Unfortunately, no old photographs remained from the towns heyday,and experts feared a misrepresentation of the past ifrestoration was carried out. The state historical society recommended managing the site to permit the towns natural deterioration. Major restorations were rejected infavour of simple shoring and bracing. To accommodatetourism needs, minimal construction activities were rec-ommended including parking, footpaths and signage. The local historical society, however, recommended that the town be completely restored. It favoured more inten-sive tourism and was not concerned with philosophicalissues and the consequences of intervention. In the end,the town was restored but with doubts remaining overwhether the quality, character and authenticity of the sitewas compromised. Practically, policy decisions are often heavily influenced by economic considerations. A decision on maintaining thevalues of ancient ruins in relation to the extent to whichstabilisation and conservation is carried out may be afunction of the funds and personnel available. Allowingvisitors to view a ruin from a distance may be more prac-tical and preferable than the more expensive option ofstructurally stabilising the site to permit visitor access. Insome cases all that may be needed is vegetation controlto reduce deterioration. 5.2.2 At World Heritage sites, policies and objectives must be in line with original integrity or authentici-ty values.

Stakeholders involvement in setting goals and objectives links a tourism strategy withthose who will have an impact on a site now and in thefuture. Stakeholders can be consulted on a number ofmanagement concerns such as infrastructure develop-ment and monitoring programmes. Stakeholders usuallyinclude government officials, members of the environ-mental and conservation community, scientists, historicpreservation organisations, hotel and tour agency owners,visitors, guides and residents. Following is a list of stakeholders with suggestions on how they may contribute to developing tourism goals andobjectives. Park, forestry or archaeological department officials may provide information on past management and visitorissues. Guides can offer information on the social and environ- mental conditions of the site, and their input can bring to light important interpretation issues. Guides working for tourist agencies can give advice on their employers concerns and input on site monitoringneeds.", "tokens": 343}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_81", "original_index": 81, "content": "Principles of the ICOMOS International Cultural Tourism Charter Policy statements may be based on the following principles  Since domestic and international tourism are among the foremost vehicles for cultural exchange, conserva-tion should provide responsible and well managedopportunities for members of the host community andvisitors to experience and understand that communitysheritage and culture at first hand. The relationship between heritage places and tourism is dynamic and may involve conflicting values. It shouldbe managed in a sustainable way for present andfuture generations. Conservation and tourism planning for heritage places should ensure that the visitor experience would beworthwhile, satisfying and enjoyable. Host communities and indigenous peoples should be involved in planning for conservation and tourism. Tourism and conservation activities should benefit the host community. Tourism promotion programmes should protect and enhance natural and cultural heritage characteristics. Note The full text of the Charter appears as Appendix 2. Community leaders often have concerns and ideas about how tourism will affect local social values and eco-nomic development. For example, local leaders may thinkit necessary to avoid tourism impacts on the main popu-lation centre. Hotel owners can have a direct influence on tourism development and community interactions. They may beconcerned about potential crowding, or coordinating vis-itor arrivals between the hotel and site management per-sonnel through a reservation system. Hotel owners canalso help in the development of interpretation and pro-motional materials. Tour operators will have concerns about visitor comfort and security. They stay apprised of changes in the inter-national travel market and usually have information onuser preferences and demand. The value of contactingtour operators to discuss their concerns, potentialdemand for a site, and possible cooperation on activitiessuch as marketing should not be underestimated.", "tokens": 345}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_82", "original_index": 82, "content": "Scientists can spell out concerns about significant flora and fauna or historical or archaeological remains. Theycan suggest ways to protect resources from impacts andoffer advice on attracting research grants. Field assistantsworking directly with scientists can share practical con-cerns and complementary information. 5.3.2 Background information should supplement the list of stakeholder concerns. When developing goals and objectives, libraries and department archives areuseful sources of valuable supplemental information, forexample on endemic or endangered species of fauna orflora, or on visitor use and impacts on wildlife or archae-ological ruins. National tourism and protected area lawsand policies including the legal requirements for licensingand taxation can help in setting government policies andin understanding current conditions of tourism develop-ment. Old master plans and the recommendations con-tained in them are also useful. At Copan, a Mayan WorldHeritage archaeological site in Honduras, a major interna-tional hotel was built even though many had suggestedthat smaller existing hotels in a nearby town would havebeen adequate with some minor upgrading. Many unat-tended ruins were destroyed just because they lay near anew access road to the Copan ruins. 5.4 Identifying common interests with stakeholders 5.4.1 Conflicts with the local community may pre- vent cooperation in tourism development. For this reason consultation with community members during planning is essential. They may voice concerns that devel-opment will bring increased pollution or crime that tourist traffic may endanger their children or that touristswill have a negative impact on social conditions, for example by wearing inappropriate dress.", "tokens": 312}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_83", "original_index": 83, "content": "They also mayfear that the development will not benefit local people,for example that jobs as guides will be given to outsiders.5WH  manual1-ch5 311002 1458 Page 4 Setting Policy Goals and Management Objectives 49Consultations may result in actions such as the creation of a tourism development committee or a system for traininglocal guides. Tour operators may be asked to educate theirclients to respect community values. A visitor centre maybe built some distance away from the village to avoidencroaching on everyday village life. 5.4.2 Environmentalists and conservationists have important concerns over the potential negativeimpacts of tourism development on natural and cul-tural sites. Environmentalists involved in the protection of flora and fauna may fear that opening an area fortourism could also invite hunters, or they may voice con-cern over potential disturbances to nesting birds, forexample. Archaeologists might warn against vandalismand other potential damage to ruins and monuments.Both groups may complain about increased litter, particu-larly if existing funds are insufficient for garbage collec-tion. Both are likely to press for conditions in whichvisitors do not feel rushed or crowded, or spend too muchtime waiting to enter a site. Members of this stakeholdergroup often complain of a lack of communication withthe tourism sector, including both the ministry and privateoperators. They may also complain that staff membersvalue tourism development more than educational activi-ties and scientific research. This stakeholder group might wish to persuade site man- agers to implement an efficient reservation system, tolimit access to areas with pristine, fragile ecosystems or tovulnerable archaeological sites, and to mount an educa-tion campaign to minimise impacts. They might insist onstrict supervision of visitors, especially student sciencegroups. Researchers often advocate the appointment of ascience adviser at the site who could promote and man-age research.", "tokens": 382}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_84", "original_index": 84, "content": "Agreement could be reached on specific tar-gets for tourism promotion and development. 5.4.3 Tour guides are a valuable source of informa- tion and advice concerning conditions affecting theenvironment as well as the visitor experience. They will point out unsafe trail sections and help ensure thattrails are maintained for comfortable walking, as well asalert management to problems of crowding and noise.Guides can inform management when local people usethe site for hunting and killing birds and other wildlife. Like the environmentalists and conservationists, guides are usually concerned about the quality of their clientsexperience, and will insist that the time it takes to pur-chase a ticket be kept to a minimum, that congestion onthe access road to the site be eliminated, and so on. They may suggest maintaining limits on the numbers of visitors permitted at a site through use of an effective reservation system, and measures such as staggering visits by pro-moting afternoon tours. A direct telephone or radio con-nection between site management staff and guideswould ensure consistent and effective communication.5.4.4 Hotel owners and managers usually want a site to provide a broad base of opportunities for differ-ent types of visitors. They are also concerned about crowding and littering, the amount of parking at the siteentrance, and the presence of persistent beggars andorsouvenir hawkers. As with independent guides, hotelsappreciate consistent and reliable communication withsite management, perhaps by a specially installed directphone line. Members of this stakeholder group might ask staff man- agement to develop a reservation system for tours. Theywould also advocate formation of a tourism advisory com-mittee to meet with the local community about develop-ment issues and the needs and preferences of tourists. 5.4.5 Overseas tour operators and ground operators are especially concerned about logistical questions.Will their tour groups have to wait in line behind other tours scheduled at the same time?", "tokens": 391}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_85", "original_index": 85, "content": "Will their groups meetup with noisy or inconsiderate groups?

These stakeholders often advo-cate efficient reservation systems, good communicationsand regular maintenance. 5.4.6. A stakeholder advisory group can facilitate the development of policy goals and managementobjectives. Such a panel provides a mechanism for exchanging ideas and information. The group shoulddraft a written policy or vision statement that can bedeveloped and publicly endorsed. The group could alsohelp to set management objectives, including standardsfor desired conditions and actions. Practically, stakeholder groups can be engaged in the management process and serve as forums for exchangingviews and reaching agreement on tourism issues. If anadvisory group is not feasible, some mechanism forexchanging ideas is needed. This can be as simple as aregular exchange of memos between site management staff and stakeholder groups, to solicit opinions anddescribe current activities. The process of developing goals and objectives should also take into account the sites uniqueness in relation toother sites with which it competes. Tour operators andother tourism professionals who may be members of theadvisory group can be a valuable source of information about a sites comparative advantage over others in the area. 5.5 Visitors preferences and demand 5.5.1 Data about visitors preferences and demandfor a site is essential for establishing objectives.Information on the number of visitors and their likes, dis-likes, motivations and expectations will help the planner5WH  manual1-ch5 311002 1458 Page 5 Setting Policy Goals and Management Objectives 50divide visitors into subgroups of people with similar char- acteristics, needs and spending behaviours.", "tokens": 378}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_86", "original_index": 86, "content": "This informa-tion is useful in setting objectives for infrastructure,personnel needs and education and interpretation pro-grammes. Combined with data on tourism markets, theinformation can be used to develop objectives for attract-ing certain types of tourists to a site. For example, man-agers with a policy of boosting local communitydevelopment might set a goal of attracting tour operatorswho use local guides. 5.5.2 Numbers of visitors also affect management objectives and infrastructure and facility design. The experience at Liffey Falls in Tasmania illustrates the useful-ness of information about visitor preferences when settingmanagement objectives. The Forestry Commission discov-ered that visitors wanted to see the falls and were notinterested in the other available recreation facilities.Knowing this, officials were able to concentrate theirefforts and save a considerable amount of money andstaff time. At Uluru National Park in Australia, a survey found that most tourists mainly wanted to see and to climb AyersRock. Fewer cited experiencing the outback and seeingwildlife as prime reasons for visiting. This informationhelped park staff to focus their attention on Ayers Rock. 5.5.3 Existing sources can be used to start the process of assessing visitor preferences anddemand. Information and statistics from the tourism min- istry, protected area staff and tour operators can help pro-vide an idea of current and future demand and the mix ofmarket segments. National tourism officials have informa-tion on tourism development and studies or statistics ontourism markets. Statistics and reports from the site staffand tour operators can provide an idea of visitor prefer-ences and demand. Existing studies from national tourismofficials can provide information on the kinds of touriststhe government is attempting to attract and the type oftourist expected to visit a site in the future.

Through discussions, officialscan help managers identify changes in visitor interests,activities and travel patterns. A look at tourism development in neighbouring commu- nities can indicate a sites potential demand and showhow tourism has affected the economies and social con-ditions of the community. Local guides and hotel and pension owners can provide information on visitor prefer-ences and demand cycles. Also, because they are in con-stant touch with changes in the international travelmarkets, they can help in identifying and tracking userpreferences and demand, for example, whether visitorstravel in tours or organised groups or travel independent-ly. They can provide helpful information for developinginfrastructure and interpretation material. Scientists and archaeologists can also share information about visitorpreferences and patterns. 5.5.4 Observations, surveys and interviews provide more detailed visitor profiles. Such information on vis- itors and their interests may be needed to fine-tune man-agement objectives, for example, on crowdingpreferences or tourists spending patterns. Observationsare qualitative and less exact than surveys and interviews,but they are quick, inexpensive and useful for indicatingtrends or suggesting targets for an eventual survey orinterview. Observations may include organisation group size, forms of transportation, type and amount of equipment,uses of time, maps of where people go and behaviourincluding languages used and noise levels.

Respondents have the right to refuse to answer a ques- tion or stop answering questions at any time. The researcher should guarantee confidentiality, or, if the data collected are to be published, the respondentshould give written consent. Personal information israrely necessary a mailing list of visitors can be com-piled separately from a survey. The survey questions and procedure should take into account cross-cultural, ethnic or gender sensitivities. 5WH  manual1-ch5 311002 1458 Page 6 Setting Policy Goals and Management Objectives 51TYPES OF DATA Qualitative data can provide a rich body of descriptive information that can be used in its own right or to helpset the objectives of quantitative surveys. Methods forcollecting qualitative data include interviews, focusgroups and observation. A drawback is that qualitativedata are difficult to measure and require subjective judgement. Quantitative data can be collected in face-to-face or telephone interviews, or through questionnaires.Quantitative data are numerical and can be coded for sta-tistical analysis. Attitudes and opinions are measuredusing rating scales.", "tokens": 370}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_89", "original_index": 89, "content": "While quantitative methods may sam-ple just a portion of the population, with statistical analy-sis they yield fairly reliable generalisations about thepopulation as a whole. One drawback of such data is thatthey can be impersonal and fail to reveal why visitors feelor behave the way they do. Another is that defects in sur-vey design or interviewing skills may lead to bias. Designfaults may also lead to the collection of a sample that isnot truly representative of the population under study. DATA-GATHERING TECHNIQUES Participant observation, conducted without overt con- tact with the subjects, can be used to gather qualitativeand quantitative data. The researcher becomes part of thegroup being observed and may make important discover-ies about visitor preferences. Such information could beuseful in the planning of a detailed survey, for example byhelping to identify categories of tourists. Face-to-face interviews are an occasion to ask in-depth questions on a particular subject. Respondents areallowed to answer freely without time constraints. Aswith participant observation, this exercise can be a prel-ude to developing a quantitative survey. Interviews areless prone to misunderstanding and avoid problems asso-ciated with illiteracy and language barriers. Follow-upquestions can correct for inadequate replies. Interviewsare especially useful when the subject is complex, andwhen privacy is needed to avoid peer pressure. The disad-vantages of interviews include that they are more labourintensive and costlier than other methods, and that inter-viewer bias is difficult to avoid. Focus groups hold facilitated discussions aimed at allow ing certain issues to emerge. A leader moderates the dis-cussion and records the results. Focus group discussions permit a wide range of responses and take less time over-all than in-depth interviews. The format allows observa-tion of the participants that can provide insights into their behaviours and attitudes.", "tokens": 372}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_90", "original_index": 90, "content": "Self-completed questionnaires are cheaper than inter- views and can yield a great deal of information. Surveyforms may be stocked at strategic places, distributed along with entrance tickets or handed out to a sampling of the target group. The main disadvantage is that fol-low-up is not possible with individual respondents. 5.5.5 Interviews are more labour-intensive but can provide an in-depth view of a given situation.Interviews require specific training, and the results canvary according to the subjectivity of the interviewer. Face-to-face interviews using open-ended questions usuallyprovide a rich complement to quantitative data.Interviews are also valuable because they impart informa-tion to interviewees about site issues. Surveys are less expensive than face-to-face interviews, can reach a broad range of visitors and can provide valu-able quantitative data, which is useful for reinforcingmanagement decisions. However, with surveys communi-cation is only one-way, and they require skills in question-naire design and data management. They are also lesseffective than interviews in educating visitors. Ideally, acombination of methods should be used to determinepreferences and construct accurate visitor profiles. Categorising tourists according to preferences and behav- iours can contribute to the realisation of a sites goals andobjectives. For example, if income generation is a keygoal, information should be compiled on variations inspending by visitors. If education of schoolchildren is a pri-ority, they should figure in a survey. 5.6 Setting objectives at sites offering multiple activities 5.6.1 At large sites, whether cultural, natural or mixed, management objectives may vary from onearea to another within the site. People visit attractions with different expectations. Serious bird-watchers maycome to a site to see an endangered species in a seldomvisited, quiet environment.", "tokens": 367}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_91", "original_index": 91, "content": "At the same time, local touristsmay come to the site to see an archaeological ruin and topicnic or socialise with family members, and they may benot be particularly bothered by noise levels. The Recreation Opportunity Spectrum ROS has proven a useful tool for setting objectives for these different visitorexperiences. The ROS is a means of describing howtourism and recreation will be managed for different areaswithin a site. It works under the assumption that certainactivities fit best in certain physical areas, for example,wilderness trekking fits better in relatively untouchedforests than in farming areas. It also assumes that activi-ties should provide visitors with certain experiences oropportunities, such as solitude or adventure. For example,on Tanzanias Mt. Kilimanjaro, planners created a hikingzone where numbers were restricted and visitors couldexpect infrequent contact with other walkers. An evenmore restricted wilderness zone allowed only very minimaluse. All huts and other permanent facilities wereremoved, only tent camping was permitted and the 5WH  manual1-ch5 311002 1458 Page 7 Setting Policy Goals and Management Objectives 52highest degree of solitude was provided, the area being free of permanent human presence. To separate different activities, the ROS system uses pre- established categories called opportunity classes thatmatch the sites physical resources with the activities bestsuited to them. For example at a mixed site, one area maybe managed for archaeological tourism and another forbird-watching. Opportunity classes set out the desiredconditions for the different areas and provide guidelinesfor management objectives. These include guidelines ontourismrecreation activities and infrastructure develop-ment. In the United States, parks and forest services use aset of predetermined opportunity classifications includingprimitive, semi-primitive non-motorised, semi-primitivemotorised, rural and modern urban.", "tokens": 372}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_92", "original_index": 92, "content": "Other countries havedesigned their own categories to fit the physical realitiesof their particular region. Each classification entails man-agement standards and desired conditions that fall withina sites policy goals. The information needed to identifyand establish opportunity class areas is drawn from back-ground information on policy goals, existing legislationand stakeholder concerns. Each opportunity class encompasses a set of experiences and activities for the visitor. Each has guidelines for eco-logical, social and management conditions. For example,an area classified as primitive might be maintained as awild stretch of terrain where vehicles are not permittedand where visitors are highly likely to experience physicalchallenge and solitude. Because such areas appeal totourists seeking a wilderness experience, appropriateactivities may include sports such as backpacking andcanoeing. Moving across the spectrum, rural areas within a site, for example farmland, can have varying degrees of humanimpacts and contact with other people is to be expected.Here activities such as wilderness backpacking wouldprobably not be appropriate. On the other hand, bird-watching along rural roads may be an appropriate touristactivity. Infrastructure development for different activities is close- ly related to an areas opportunity class. The ROS systemmatches infrastructure objectives with the experiences onoffer. For example, if an objective is to provide an isolatedwilderness experience, only basic infrastructure would beneeded. In populated rural areas, infrastructure may bemore sophisticated, with accommodations that fit visitorsexpectations. 5.7 Implications and recommendations  When formulating goals and objectives, the first step isto determine the purpose of tourism at a site.", "tokens": 316}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_93", "original_index": 93, "content": "Questions such as the following can stimulate thinking about thisissue Is the purpose solely to generate foreign exchange, orwill the site also be used to boost small local enterpris-es such as guiding or handicrafts?Will revenue be used to support the site, for example to pay for additional guards?How will the site look and how will it be managed?

These methodologies generate impact indi-cators and standards that are linked to site policygoals and management objectives. They are essentialfor determining when undesirable change is takingplace at a site. 6.1 General carrying capacity issues 6.1.1 The concept of carrying capacity addresses thequestion of how many people can be permitted intoan area without risk of degrading the site and thevisitors experience of it. It has generally been broken down into three categories physical, ecological andsocial. Physical carrying capacity, called facility carrying capac- ity by the World Tourism Organisation, mostly has to dowith available space the number of beds available toovernight guests, how many cars would fill a parking lot,how many campers in a campground, seats in a theatre,and so on. Concomitant to such considerations is thequestion of fresh water and electricity supply. Ecological carrying capacity is the degree to which anecosystem is able to tolerate human interference whilemaintaining sustainable functioning.", "tokens": 390}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_99", "original_index": 99, "content": "As noted in Chapter3 a curvilinear relationship may exist between use andimpact at a site, and wide variations in ecosystem resist-ance and resilience make ecological carrying capacity dif-ficult to predict. Social carrying capacity is psychological and socio-cul-tural and refers to the limit beyond which the number ofpeople in an available space would cause a decline in thequality of the recreational experience and the users satis-faction. Overcrowding is a prime example of a socio-cul-tural carrying capacity issue. Since different user groupshave different social expectations and because of compli-cated issues related to cultural resistance and resilience,this factor is also difficult to assess. 6.1.2 The concept of carrying capacity has evolved completely with a better understanding of the rela-tionship between the number of visitors and theimpacts they cause. During the 1960s and 1970s, the main focus was on developing a system for setting limitsto the number of visitors to parks, monuments and pro-tected areas as a means of safeguarding natural and cul-tural resources. The aim was to determine the point atwhich adverse impacts were likely to begin. Experiencehas shown that such a simple calculation is not feasible.Several factors are involved The onset of environmental deterioration or adverse social impacts may come sooner or later depending on varia-tions in visitor behaviour or the resistance and resilience of a given ecosystem. One destructive tourist can cause moredamage than 50 conscientious visitors. Some areas suchas meadows can handle less use than areas with moreresilient vegetation just a handful of tourists in a commu- nity may be responsible for most of the litter some com-munities may accept larger groups of tourists while othersreject them, and so on. For some individuals, a single fel- low visitor at an archaeological site would be too manyfor others, hundreds of fellow visitors would not diminishthe quality of the experience.", "tokens": 392}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_100", "original_index": 100, "content": "Setting a specific carrying capacity figure may give the false impression that a protected area is safeguardedwhen it is not. Visitors to a ruin site may be limited to 100at a time, while in an isolated corner some visitors may behelping themselves to priceless souvenirs. The carryingcapacity of a nature trail may be set at 100, but that willnot prevent some visitors from disturbing a colony of nest-ing birds as they approach to take photographs. All activities cause environmental and social impacts. Site managers must set well defined and established goals fordesired conditions that will serve as a baseline for deter-mining an acceptable level of impact. For example, man-agers need to know how much litter is dropped along aninterpretive trail before launching a visitor education cam-paign against littering, so that they can determinewhether their efforts are succeeding. When visitors to anatural area desire an experience relatively free of fellowvisitors, managers may establish a baseline number ofpeople considered unsatisfactory. Clearly, there is no magic number. Current models of visi- tor management involve setting goals and objectives, for-mulating indicators and monitoring results. 6.1.3 Planning for visitor management should be based on the idea of limits to acceptable change.The new planning methodologies assume that all activitiescause impacts and that desired conditions should serve asthe baseline for planning. Managers need to know notonly how many people are in an area, but also how theseusers are affecting the areas natural and culturalresources. The new models set limits to impacts rather than visitation. It is a matter of tracking ecological andsocial indicators through field studies and user surveys. 6.1.4 The methodology known as Limits of Acceptable Change LAC sets standards and moni-toring indicators based on management and stake-holder concerns.", "tokens": 364}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_101", "original_index": 101, "content": "When the quantifiable standards are not met, impacts have become so negative that the man-agement is prepared to take actions such as reducingaccess and restricting behaviours to avoid further degra-dation of resources, even if such actions would be unpop-ular.

When conditions approach limits of acceptable change, Carrying Capacity and Related Planning Issues6WH  manual1-ch6 311002 1500 Page 2 Carrying Capacity and Related Planning Issues 57management takes specific mitigating actions. LAC pro- grammes may set numeric visitor limits, for example 100people at a cultural site at any one time, but the overallprocess provides a much more comprehensive and effec-tive system for protecting resources. The challenge is todefine how much and what kind of change is accept-able and set indicator limits or standards for any changesthat would degrade the conditions agreed upon. LAC standards are established on the basis of stakeholder and management needs, and follow legal and Conventionguidelines. For instance, stakeholder concerns may centreon a desire to limit certain impacts by maintaining a clean,safe, uncrowded environment in a particular area of a nat-ural site. In this case, reliable indicators may include thenumber of people on a sites interpretive trail at any onetime, dangerous areas on the trail or the amount of litter. Management objectives should lead to measurable impact standards reflecting the desired conditions. Forexample, one site indicator may be the number of unsta-ble areas found on a tourist trail. In this case, the site man-ager should define what is meant by an unstable area andquantify the unstable areas along the trail.

These elements, combined with field experience, should inform meetingswith the advisory group aimed at selecting indicators totrack changes in the ecological, physical and social condi-tions. It is essential to inform those making decisions howthis information will be distributed. In general, it is notnecessary to monitor all indicators some overlap withothers and some may be simply too expensive or imprac-tical to monitor. Also, indicators should not be seen as a full measure of an impact or problem, but more anattempt to describe it. Not all problem areas and concernsare conducive to monitoring through indicators.

Inventory information determines the degree to which existing con-ditions vary from desired conditions. Information on cur-rent conditions is the baseline for establishing realistic standards, a step needed for all the LAC-type methodolo-gies. So for example, if vandalism at a rock art site is anindicator, a count of all the graffiti found around the sitewill be necessary. Any inventory exercise should be carriedout according to established, written procedures, insuringconsistent monitoring practices over the long term. Aninventory will test the basic data collection techniques andprovide the information needed for a monitoring manual.This involves the development of standardised monitoringsurveys and evaluation forms, along with instructions formaking decisions on implementing actions to correctunacceptable conditions. Recommended Criteria for Indicators  Quantitative - The indicator can be measured quantitatively. Easily measurable - It can be measured by field per-sonnel using simple equipment and sampling techniques. Relevant to concerns - The indicator genuinely reflectsthe concern being tracked. Significant - It can detect a change in conditions thatwould disrupt the functioning of an ecosystem orreduce the future desirability of an area to visitors. Sensitive - The indicator allows easy detection ofchanges in conditions that occur within a year. Reliable over time - Monitoring of the indicator canbe carried out in the same way during each monitoringcycle. Responsive to management actions - The indicatorcan detect a change in conditions resulting from management actions.

Monitoring Indicators Some Examples  Abrasion of monuments  Status of vegetation Number of human encounters while travelling per day, bynumber of groups and their sizes Signs of pollution from humans, litter, food in streams Tourists complaints about conditions Number of disturbances to an archaeological site Erosion Disturbance of wildlife populations Graffiti or vandalism Complaints from community members on deterioratingcommunity values Increase in the number of crime reports Standards are usually set to prevent degradation of cur- rent conditions. An example would be a standard for maintaining the population of a particular bird species orwater quality. In some cases, however, even while man-agers would never desire degradation, they may set stan-dards permitting a deterioration of current conditions ifthey believe that this would be a lesser evil than, forinstance, having to restrict access or impose widelyunpopular rules. Meetings of the advisory group andorstakeholders will be needed to reach consensus on settingstandards. In large natural and mixed sites, the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum ROS system can be used to setstandards for different areas within the same site,depending on the needs of different user groups.Experience in the field indicates that users may hold awide range of opinions, and consequently managersshould consider setting wider ranges of standards.

Calls continue for studies to provide policy-makers with a technical limit, a number orrange of numbers that will indicate negative change. Suchstudies can create the false impression that carryingcapacity can be reduced to a specific number indicating a clear point at which negative impacts will start to be seen.For example, at Lake Baikal, Russia, consultants wereasked to determine the number of visitors per hectare thatthe terrain around the lake could support. Figures werederived primarily from formulas involving soil impact andslope. The study also made predictions of cultural impactsbased on the number of tourists compared with the num-ber of local residents. While this methodology was easy toimplement within the allotted time for the project, it failedto take into account variations in tourist behaviour, travelpatterns and different stakeholder interests. Additionaldialogue with interest groups would have made thereports figures more relevant to the day-to-day work of site managers. More important, such dialogue wouldhave started a process for setting tourism goals and objec-tives among the stakeholders within the limits of legisla-tion on the environment and protected areas. 6.1.9 Managers may still feel the need to set numeric limits to control people at their sites.", "tokens": 364}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_106", "original_index": 106, "content": "Visitor numbers should be set in accordance with agreed upon standards.In the field, this is not an exact science, but a matter oftracking impacts through monitoring programmes andarriving at an approximate judgement of when limits arereached. In practice, several strategies will help managers justify decisions to limit visitation. Data on numbers of vis-itors and their preferences make up the best justificationfor actions restraining the number of people permitted toenter an area. This is especially true if an expert study canbe shown to the stakeholders affected by the decision.Visitor surveys could demonstrate the negative effects of crowding and the desire for solitude at an archaeologicalor sacred site. The staff available to carry out protection efforts in rela- tion to the number of visitors can also be used to justifyrestrictions. For example, the number of tourists admitted to an archaeological site may be a function of the numberof guards available for patrolling the site to ensure its pro-tection. Numbers may be controlled simply by reducingthe size of a parking lot or visitor centre. However, such ameasure may detract from visitor satisfaction if it results incrowding. A Case Study A visitor management study was carried out using the Visitor Experience and Resource Protection Process VERP at the Petra archaeological site in Jordan. Developed bythe US National Park Service, VERP is a LAC-type systemthat does not necessarily set specific numbers as long asresources and social conditions can be measured andmaintained. To this end, a monitoring programme deter-mines whether desired conditions are being met. The fol-lowing table presents several of the indicators, standardsand methods of measurement recommended by the Carrying Capacity and Related Planning Issues6WH  manual1-ch6 311002 1500 Page 4 59team.

Managers need to know when desired conditions are being threatened,for example, with increasing water pollution in a streamor when waiting lines become too long at an entrance. Awell-developed and regular monitoring programme canprovide resource managers with data to justify sometimescontroversial actions such as limiting the number of peo-ple allowed into a site at a time. Monitoring visitors likes,dislikes and travel patterns, as well as their impacts, canhelp identify and justify needed actions in the changingtourist industry. 6.2.2 The most difficult aspect of monitoring is ensuring that it is carried out on a regular basis.Managers are faced with many pressing day-to-day prob-lems and often have little time or desire to carry out mon-itoring exercises. However, monitoring is effective only if it is done regularly if it cannot be sustained, its usefulnessis severely limited. well as their impacts, can help identifyand justify needed actions in the changing tourist industry. 6.2.3 Many types of monitoring procedures are pos- sible depending on the level of accuracy desired andavailable resources. For example, soil erosion on a nature trail can be measured in several ways. One methodis to identify eroded sections by walking the trail andcounting variations in width, perhaps caused when visi-tors seek to avoid muddy sections. Another is to establishpermanent checkpoints at problem areas along the trail tomeasure soil loss. Each approach has advantages and dis-advantages. Examining trail conditions in a general fash-ion does not give a precise measurement, but provides agood overview. On the other hand, while permanent mon-itoring plots will provide a more accurate measure of soilloss, the method is more expensive and time-consuming. The differences in approach can also be illustrated with bird population counts.", "tokens": 391}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_108", "original_index": 108, "content": "One inexpensive method system-atically records the number of bird sightings by localguides. A more accurate but expensive method of track-ing population changes involves catching specimens withnets or setting up a transect, or a fixed corridor alongwhich species are counted on a regular basis. Fewer options exist for monitoring socio-economic condi- tions such as crowding and community attitudes. Mostsocio-economic information is obtained through ques-tionnaires or interviews, work that is labour-intensiveand time-consuming. A survey of community attitudestowards tourism, for example, takes large amounts oftime to develop, implement and analyse. A monitoringprocedure should be selected on the basis of what ques-tions need to be answered and how much time and fund-ing is available to carry out the work.At the Great BarrierReef in Australia, travel distances made monitoring eachcampsite in detail prohibitively expensive. Managersdecided instead on the more cost-effective tactic of sam-pling a cross-section of camping areas. Finally, all monitoring programmes should be evaluated to determine how well they measure the indicators. Thisevaluation should also determine how large a measuredchange must be for management to be confident that itis the result of visitor impact and not errors in data collection. 6.2.4 Monitoring of historic monuments must take into account values of integrity and authenticity.Indicators of structural or engineering conditions cannottranslate into an overview of the complete health of a sitesince they do not reflect values of integrity or authentici-ty.

Experience has shown that a simple monitoring pro- gramme is better than none at all and can be more effec-tive than costly ones. For example, with historic buildingsand other built cultural sites, a simple report with notesand photos has been found to be far more useful thandetailed, item-by-item reports on conditions. Short, simplereports covering general problems and a few specific problem areas allow staff to determine which propertiesrequire the most attention and to offer guidance to their agencies.

Written management objectiveshelp give direction to the development of measurablestandards. While managers will have the final decision, standards should be set on the basis of discussions with key stake-holders. Wherever possible, standards should not allow adowngrading of current conditions. For example, a stan-dard for maintaining the population of a particular birdspecies should not be set below current levels unless off-set by overwhelming advantages. Standards should be setwhenever possible to reflect ideal conditions. Baseline data is essential to the establishment of realis- tic standards.

However, if eco-logical, physical andor social conditions approach orreach unacceptable levels, action must be taken. Knowledge of management strategies and solutionswill arm the manager with the options available forrestoring the desired conditions. Decision-making is also helped by an awareness of the consequencesassociated with these strategies and actions. 7.1 General issues 7.1.1 Any management action must begin with iden-tification of the likely causes of a defined problem.A decline in conditions is not necessarily caused bytourism. Coral may deteriorate naturally litter at anarchaeological site may be caused by locals, not tourists,and so on. Once the cause is clearly identified, correctiveactions can be taken. Well-focused actions, attacking thecause of the problem, save time and money. For example,an ongoing campaign may maintain an area affected bylitter, but it can be expensive and does not attack thecause of the problem. It may be more cost- effective toidentify the source of the litter and combine a mainte-nance programme with an education campaign thatattempts to affect peoples behaviour. 7.1.2 Management actions can be direct or indirect. Direct management actions confront problems of humanbehaviour through regulations that may entail enforce-ment, restricting activities or rationing use.", "tokens": 432}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_116", "original_index": 116, "content": "Indirect meth-ods seek to affect behaviour through education,information and persuasion. Visitors can be informedabout the impacts connected with a certain activity, orgiven information that encourages the use of certainareas over threatened areas. Other indirect actions includephysical alterations, such as the redirection of a trail to amore resilient area of a forest, that influence the move-ment of visitors. In general, indirect actions are more successful in remote areas, where visitors freedom to explore is usually a pri-mary goal. Direct approaches are often used to prohibitvisitors from entering fragile or dangerous areas, forexample at an archaeological site where they might dam-age a priceless fresco. Experts say regulations succeedwhen they have strong public support, are carefullyexplained, and when visitors have some say in how theyare implemented. Visitors must understand why a behav-iour change is desirable. Once implemented, of course,regulations must be enforced. In practice, a combination of methods is generally used. For example, both direct and indirect actions can be usedto minimise visitors impact on a coral reef. Site staff candesign an extensive public information campaign that caninclude printed materials, direct advertising and schoolprogrammes. Tour operators can be managed through permits, regulations and enforcement actions aimed at concentrating recreation activities at resistant reefs. Acombination of methods is also recommended for con-trolling vandalism, including physical protection of theresource as well as education, making a site inaccessible to vehicles, increasing admission fees and protecting sitesby not promoting them. 7.1.3 Factors to consider when selecting manage- ment actions include whether they meet objectives,their likelihood of success and difficulties of imple-mentation, particularly cost. Management strategies should be in line with objectives.", "tokens": 344}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_117", "original_index": 117, "content": "For example, if a man-agement objective at a Himalayan site is to offer visitorsthe freedom to explore, then a softer managementapproach may be appropriate. Here staff may wish toemphasise educating trekkers on low-impact expeditionbehaviour. On the other hand, if a sites objective is to pro-tect a priceless mosaic at an ancient monument, a moredirect approach may be appropriate such as the deploy-ment of guards to protect the site from looters or vandalsand to regulate tourism activity near the work of art. Actions should have a high probability of achieving the desired outcome. Before taking actions that may face resist-ance, it is important to ensure that norms and regulationsgive managers the legal mandate to act, and that appropri-ate enforcement systems will support its application. Awareness of the visitor profile helps to ensure success. For example, a large group of foreign visitors may bestrongly motivated towards the protection of an endan-gered species but unaware that they are disturbing theanimal during feeding times. In this case, educationalmaterials explaining low-impact viewing techniques maybe the best method for minimising impacts. Actions should be relatively easy and inexpensive to imple- ment. In general, direct methods are considered moretime-consuming and costly, while indirect actions arethought to be cheaper in the long run. 7.1.4 Experts suggest limiting regulation to the min- imum necessary to effectively accomplish manage-ment objectives. The most effective but least restrictive management actions should be implemented first. Theresults should be monitored, and more restrictive actions may be implemented if necessary until conditionsimprove. For example, to deal with uncontrolled dumpingof garbage, an educational campaign may be launcheddescribing the problem and inviting voluntary compliancewith a regulation against dumping at the site. If voluntarymethods fail, a fine can be imposed.

Inthese situations, the cost and time involved in implement-ing indirect methods is weighed against immediate prob-lems, such as the need to prevent the rapid degradationof an archaeological site by visitors buying objects stolenfrom the site. 7.2 Reducing the number of people who enter an area Reducing visitation in high use areas is a justifiable means of avoiding social impacts such as crowding, butmay not by itself substantially reduce some ecologicalimpacts. Reducing the number of people in an area caneffectively reduce crowding or congestion, for example ata historical monument. However, since some environmen-tal impacts follow the curvilinear trend discussed inChapter 3, in natural areas such measures may not solveenvironmental problems unless visitors are also directed tomore resistant areas. An Overview of Management Strategies Management strategies affecting the level and nature of exploitation of a site and its physical and socio-economicenvironment seek to minimise or reduce the impact ofeach visitor. Factors, or variables that can be affected orcontrolled, include the number of visitors, the types ofactivity, visitors behaviour and the environments physicaland social resistance and resilience. A number of strate-gies address these variables Visitor levels may be controlled by reducing the total number of people allowed at a site or reducing the num-ber of people allowed in one or several areas of a site bydispersing them or by concentrating them in a specificarea.", "tokens": 378}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_119", "original_index": 119, "content": "Types of activities can be changed or influenced by addressing the ways in which the activity is practised,offering incentives for people to practise particular activi-ties or imposing direct actions to restrict certain activities. A sites physical environment may be altered to make it more resistant to impacts through the use of infrastructure. A sites social environment can be affected by reducing conflicts between visitors and between visitors and thelocal community. Management options for reducing the number of visitors to a site can include  restricting entry or closing an area  limiting group sizes implementing a quota or permit system increasing fees or not providing facilities.Options for dispersing or concentrating people to reduce use in a particular area can include  restricting the number of people who can enter the threatened area  limiting the permissible length of stay in the threat- ened area  raising the entrance fee for the threatened area only not providing facilities in the threatened area zoning an area for a particular activity and not per- mitting the activity in the threatened area  directing tourists to more resilient areas through zon- ing, visitor education and offering more facilities orfewer facilities  charging different entrance fees on certain days of the week and  using a promotion and interpretation campaign to influence the use of one area over another. Visitors behaviour can be changed through  education programmes teaching low-impact ways to visit a site, e.g., techniques for observing wildlifewithout disturbing it  interpretation programmes teaching respect for a sites resources and protection issues. Site managers may encourage visitors to practise particular activities by  raising or lowering prices for certain types of visitors  restricting opening hours, e.g. opening a site early for bird-watchers or closing it early to discourage otherclientele  offering or not offering infrastructure prohibiting certain activities through regulation and enforcement.", "tokens": 351}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_120", "original_index": 120, "content": "A sites physical environment can be made more resistant to impacts by  using infrastructure to harden a site, e.g., harden- ing a trail with a wooden boardwalk or installing per-manent moorings  relocating infrastructure to more resilient areas, e.g., moving a mountain refuge to an area less prone toerosion. Actions for reducing conflicts between visitors include  zoning an area for compatible activities  influencing the types of tourism activities practised at a site by providing or not providing facilities.Strategies and Solutions to Tourism Management Problems 7WH  manual1-ch7 311002 1503 Page 3 66Options for reducing conflict between local people and the communities include  channelling economic benefits to local populations  incorporating socio-cultural values into the sites man- agement planning and development by increasing community participation. Also, where light use causes considerable environmental damage, decreases in traffic in the area may not have cor-respondingly positive effects. In such cases reducing visi- tor traffic may do little to boost recovery rates for soil andvegetation and an area may need to be closed for recov-ery to occur. On sites that have already suffered degradation to vege- tation, practically all use may have to be curtailed beforerecovery can occur. Impacts to water and wildlife resources are more varied and in some cases can respond to a reduction in use levels. For example, bears in theYellowstone National Park World Heritage site pose a greater problem in high-use areas, and reducing visitationmay reduce incidents between bears and campers. 7.2.1 In some areas, even if limits are imposed, meas- ures to concentrate and control visitors are neededto reduce ecological impacts. People have a tendency to go to the same places and follow the same routes.However, once people arrive at an established site such asa camping ground, they tend to disperse within the limitsof the camping area.", "tokens": 396}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_121", "original_index": 121, "content": "Limiting use -- for example by reduc-ing the number of campsites around a lake -- wouldreduce the number of visitors but not necessarily reduce their ecological impact as they spread out over all thecampsites. Actions would be needed to both reduce thenumber of people and ensure the permanent closing ofselected campsites. On the other hand, in lightly usedareas, visitor reductions can minimise ecological impactsas long as use levels are kept low, visitors are instructed inlow-impact techniques and they avoid fragile areas. Evenone uneducated party of visitors can inflict serious damage. 7.2.2 Limiting the length of stay at a site can reduce numbers and alleviate crowding problems but maynot necessarily reduce environmental impacts. Limits can be placed on time spent anywhere at the site or atspecific areas, a measure that helps reduce crowding.Length-of-stay limits at heavily used natural areas areunlikely to have any effect on ecological impacts unlessthe limits are very restrictive and targeted to reduce meas-urable indicators. Ecological impacts are best reduced byimposing length-of-stay limits in lightly used areas infragile areas, a long stay in any one place could causeunacceptable impacts.7.2.3 Closing an area can be an effective way to pro- tect or restore environmental quality. The measure encourages the recovery of vegetation and reduceswildlife impacts. For example, visitors to Big Bend NationalPark in Texas, USA, are excluded during the breeding season of peregrine falcons to protect their nesting sites.Closure of an area, however, is a direct action that can becontroversial and have economic and social ramifications.Any closure should be explained to the local community,not just to would-be visitors. 7.2.4 Reducing numbers by limiting the size of par- ties can also help control ecological and socialimpacts. Large parties can cause overcrowding as well as visitor conflicts.", "tokens": 389}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_122", "original_index": 122, "content": "In more popular areas, limits on party sizeand an educational campaign may be needed to reduceimpacts and to ensure more privacy for each group of vis-itors. In such cases educational programmes should stressthe importance of using existing areas and keeping thempleasant for the next visitors. Big groups are likely to create wider disturbed areas than smaller groups because they tend to spread out over alarger area. They can also disturb an area more rapidlythan a small party. However in an area that is alreadyheavily affected, it makes little difference if a group size is10 or 50. 7.2.5 Quotas can be used to reduce visitor levels but raise several issues. A point to consider is the finan-cial cost of implementing and administering thequota system. If staffing is insufficient, a quota system probably cannot be maintained over the long term. Also,quotas favour people who can book in advance, exclud-ing other categories of potential visitors. Any sort of limitation may annoy visitors who cherish their freedom. Quota systems may especially irk those whoconsider themselves traditional users of a site. As a resultthey may choose to go elsewhere, and other sites may notbe able to cope with increased use. Thus, for a quota sys-tem to be successful, access should be limited to alterna-tive sites and user groups need to understand and acceptthe rationing technique being implemented. 7.2.6 Increasing visitor fees and other charges can reduce visitor numbers. The laws of supply and demand dictate that higher fees at a site will reduce visitation. Afactor to consider when raising fees is the elasticity ofdemand, or how sensitive visitors are to a change in thecost of entering an area. This information can be gleanedfrom surveys. Another factor to consider is that visitorswant pricing schemes to be easy and straightforward.They tend to prefer an all-inclusive fee over a main feeplus separate charges such as for parking or taking pho-tographs.", "tokens": 400}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_123", "original_index": 123, "content": "Setting visitor fees may also involve setting dif-ferent entrance fees for local people and foreigners. Strategies and Solutions to Tourism Management Problems7WH  manual1-ch7 311002 1503 Page 4 67Reducing Demand with Higher Visitor Fees Higher entrance fees can lower demand, reducing the number of visitors, without necessarily reducing overallrevenue. An increase in the park entry fee at KeoladeoNational Park in India, for example, resulted in an 11 percent decrease in tourism down from 126,539 in 1996-97to 113,004 in 1997- 98. Overall, revenue more thandoubled over the period with the number of foreigntourists climbing by four percent, from 40,894 in 1996-97to 42,532 in 1997-1998. 7.2.7 Not providing facilities can reduce visitor num- bers. Limiting infrastructure such as camping areas or parking spaces can reduce visitor numbers just as addinginfrastructure can increase numbers. Simply makingaccess more difficult, for instance, by locating parking far-ther away from entrances, can also slow visitation. InCosta Rica, community pressure to limit tourism at aReserve put a stop to a plan to pave the access road to thecommunity and the reserve. On the other hand, increas-ing infrastructure such as adding signs and informationalplaques can increase the popularity of a site and itsresources, for example, an underwater shipwreck. This strategy raises several issues including safety con- cerns. At a rain forest park, for example, managementmay want to provide a system of signs, boardwalks andbridges to direct visitors safely back to the entrance ratherthan run the risk of having to carry out expensive search-and-rescue operations. The elasticity of demand related to infrastructure develop- ment may vary from one site to another. Many WorldHeritage sites, because they are unique, can attract signif-icant numbers of people even if infrastructure develop-ment is limited. For example, Mount Everest wouldprobably continue to attract substantial numbers of expe-ditions with or without infrastructure and facilities.", "tokens": 442}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_124", "original_index": 124, "content": "TheInca archaeological site at Machu Picchu would continueto attract large numbers of tourists without the additionof a cable car. This type of policy requires managers to keep a record of visitor demand to track changes with different levels ofinfrastructure. Even more important are on-site interviewswith tourists and tour operators to help staff to determinethe effects of infrastructure policy. By maintaining ongo-ing dialogue with stakeholders such as tour operatorswho are members of the sites tourism advisory board andwho have an intimate knowledge of visitor preferencesand movements, site managers can obtain practical adviceon the effects of these policies. 7.3 Weighing whether to disperse or con- centrate visitors 7.3.1 Concentrating people can limit social and envi- ronmental impacts. The strategy offers a high level ofcontrol and protection for sensitive resources. By limiting use to a few selected areas within a site, particularly areasthat are resistant to impacts or at least not as sensitive toimpacts, the policy confines disturbance to a smaller area.So at sites with sensitive resources, a concentration strat-egy can be used to direct visitors to areas where resourcesare more resilient and resistant. For example, some coralsare more resistant to impacts than others, so visitors maybe concentrated at more resistant areas. At Stonehenge,except for certain religious groups who are free to enterat certain times, visitors are not permitted to cross thesites outer perimeter. Besides limiting impacts to certain areas, concentrating use may open up new opportunities. For example, thepolicy may provide a rare opportunity to experience anarea in relative isolation, perhaps at an archaeological site.The chance to be part of a small group visiting an isolat-ed, highly protected site may be unique, and one thatpeople may also be willing to pay more for.", "tokens": 362}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_125", "original_index": 125, "content": "A policy of concentrating may help avert possible impacts on naturally fragile areas resulting from the tendency oftourism enterprises such as hotel chains and theme parksto grow and expand. In sites that are already heavilyimpacted, there may be no other alternative but toencourage or restrict visitors to existing use patterns.Since people tend to use the same areas and the sameroutes, implementing this measure is usually not difficult and can be accomplished through regulation or throughindirect methods such as persuading visitors to use a cer-tain area or providing infrastructure in specific areas. Concentrating tourists may produce a positive social out- come by allowing local people to escape the pressuresassociated with tourism. For example, in community ruralvillage encampments developed for tourists in Senegal,tourist accommodations are situated well away from thevillage centre. In Ujung Kulon National Park in West Javain Indonesia, tourism activities are restricted to a zone thatis managed by a private company that provides accom-modation and services. A possible disadvantage of concentrating use is that it changes the social climate of an environment for the visi-tors. At many sites, when tourists are clustered together,for example in an enclave of small hotels, they lose thefeeling of solitude. This may be contrary to the visitorexperience that was originally planned andor what origi-nally attracted people to the site. 7.3.2 Dispersing visitors is seldom simple and may not mitigate impacts. Limiting environmental impacts in natural areas by dispersing use to different areas can beeffective in areas where use levels are low and visitors areconscientious about their behaviour. A dispersal policyshould be supported with programmes designed to con-trol where people go and how they engage in recreation-al activities.", "tokens": 358}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_126", "original_index": 126, "content": "The policy may not be feasible at natural siteswith limited resources for educating or controlling visitors.Strategies and Solutions to Tourism Management Problems 7WH  manual1-ch7 311002 1503 Page 5 68In addition, careful monitoring of a dispersal programme is needed because of the high potential for spreadingproblems. Dispersing visitors by extending the tourist season is an option that may have ecological consequences. For exam-ple, using quotas and visitor permits can reduce crowdingbut may concentrate use in a season during which vege-tation and wildlife are more fragile. Wildlife is especiallyvulnerable during the reproductive months and when ani-mals feed for winter. During periods of higher rainfall andsnowmelt, the ground may be more susceptible to com-paction and breaking. Plants are more vulnerable duringgrowth seasons. At cultural sites, such as monuments with well-developed and protective infrastructure where there is little risk ofenvironmental impacts, dispersing visitors is an effectiveway to relieve crowding. Dispersing visitors to differentareas of a site can be accomplished through regulations orthrough information and persuasion. It can also beaccomplished through the strategic placement of infra-structure. If staffing levels allow, direct actions such asissuing permits may also be effective. A permit systemincreases the distance between parties and supports amanagement objective of providing an experience inwhich human encounters are infrequent. 7.3.3 The decision to concentrate or disperse tourism should reflect policy goals and management objectives. A frequent policy goal is to assure that the benefits of tourism flow to the communities around a site.This may lead to pressure to open up new areas of a siteto visitors. Tourism has a tendency to spread, and can leadin turn to the spread of social and ecological impacts.", "tokens": 361}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_127", "original_index": 127, "content": "If onthe other hand local economic development is a key goal,and there is sufficient revenue-generating potential toreplace current economic activities in a given area, then expanding tourism to the area may be appropriate. But if the main policy goal is protection of an endangered species and promoting visits by biologists, expandingtourism within a park may limit opportunities for researchbecause of increased tourism impacts in sensitive areas. 7.4 Changing the physical environment to resist impacts 7.4.1 Increasing a sites resistance to visitor impacts by installing or modifying infrastructure is generallyreferred to as site-hardening. Adding infrastructure, or hardening a site, strengthens its physical durability. Thismay involve surfacing access routes and trails, or buildingshelters for trekkers, or barriers to prevent people fromtouching priceless mosaics such as at the Taj Mahal. Anexample of extensive hardening of a cultural site is at theGreat Temple of Abu Simbel, in Egypt, where the dailyinflux of 2,000 tourists was causing traffic jams. Inside thetemple, their respiration increased the humidity and car-bon dioxide in the air, causing salt deposits to form on thewalls. To address the traffic problems, management implemented a one-way road system. A ventilation systemwas installed to reduce the humidity and the temperaturein the burial chamber. Another way to avoid impacts issimply to move infrastructure away from sensitive areas. 7.4.2 Hardening has both costs and benefits because it changes the nature of the visitors experience.Hardening can lead to a change in visitor profile. TheMilford track in New Zealand and the Overland track inTasmania, both popular backpacking routes, saw an increase in use during the 1980s. Management respond-ed to the resulting impacts by rationing use and harden-ing the tracks surfaces. Consequently, some visitorsconsidered the tracks too easy and stopped using them. Making experiences easier by hardening a site can also increase the level of crowding.", "tokens": 406}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_128", "original_index": 128, "content": "In Tasmania, a boardwalkwas built to restrict access to parts of the Gorden River.For business reasons, tour group sizes were not reduced,and groups could number more than 50. Crowding ontothe boardwalk, the visitors had difficulty photographingone of the sites star attractions, a famous 2,000-year-oldHuon pine tree. Another effect of site hardening is that added materials may not blend in with the surrounding environment,compromising the original values of the site. One solutionis to use natural materials instead of intrusive man-madematerials. For example, fast-growing plants can be usedto block a trail leading to a fragile or restricted area, or anentrance may be filled in with natural debris and rocks. 7.5 Changing visitor behaviour 7.5.1 Interpretation and education programmes can mitigate environmental and social impacts.Educational programmes instruct people on how best tobehave at a site. Interpretation programmes inform andexplain the sites resources and significance to the visitor. Visitors can be taught low-impact techniques at both cul- tural and natural sites. In the United States, a Save theManatee Campaign involved distributing guidelines totourists and resulted in a decline in manatee mortality andinjury. At the Luxor site, in Egypt, authorities reported thatby explaining management problems to visitors they suc-ceeded in distributing visitor movements more evenly.Interpretation and education programmes, although theymay take time to succeed, may be preferable to infra-structure development because they are less likely tochange the visitor experience and displace original targetgroups. Certain impacts can be almost eliminated by teaching vis- itors minimum-impact techniques. In Tasmania, on theOverland track in the Cradle Mountain-Lake St. ClairNational Park, trekkers came down with gastroenteritisbecause they were burying their waste too close to camp-ing huts, contaminating water and food supplies.", "tokens": 390}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_129", "original_index": 129, "content": "At oneStrategies and Solutions to Tourism Management Problems7WH  manual1-ch7 311002 1503 Page 6 69point up to half of the users were reporting falling ill. To correct the situation, park management mailed materialsto walking clubs, environmental groups and campingstores outlining the problem and the solution that walkersbury their waste at least 100 metres from huts, campsitesand streams. The following summer, only eight to 10 per-cent of the users reported contracting gastroenteritis.Similar results have been achieved with education cam-paigns promoting low-impact wildlife viewing and otherecologically sound practices such as using stoves insteadof fires, packing out garbage and not feeding animals.Most experts in the protection of monuments also advo-cate visitor education as part of the strategy for combat-ting problems such as vandalism. 7.5.2 Interpretation and education campaigns need not be overly costly. Goals should be critically evaluated to determine whether they could be met just as effective-ly through modest means. Instead of allocating hugesums to large infrastructure projects such as sophisticatedvisitor centres, cheaper approaches may be more effec-tive, for example, a programme involving personal contactbetween visitors and management staff. In some situa-tions a team could travel from site to site to update andimprove interpretation facilities and materials, and to trainlocal managers and rangers. Educational and interpreta-tion campaigns are possible at minimal expense. Forexample on a short nature walk, small signs giving thecommon and scientific names of the flora can suffice,while larger signs can be made on more general themes. 7.5.3 Changing visitor behaviour is not a simple process. Interpretation and education campaigns stem from a desire to change visitor behaviour, a simple princi-ple in theory but complex in practice. Many factors havebeen found to influence visitor behaviour, including thefollowing Visitors want to know why they should do something.", "tokens": 394}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_130", "original_index": 130, "content": "A simple statement that an area is a low-use area does notprovide enough information. The interpretation programme must match the current reality, or confusion will result. For example, photographs and descriptions in promotional publications may not cor-respond to the visitor experience. A case in point was when the Tasmanian Forestry Commission, in educationaland promotional materials, emphasised the recreationalattractions of its forests. Feedback from visitors revealedthat they had not expected to be able to see clearcuttingfrom trails and picnic areas. One solution was to includeimages of forest production activities in the promotionalliterature. The behaviour of staff including maintenance personnel must uphold the values reflected in educational and inter-pretation materials. A visitors experience and prior knowledge may influence the effectiveness of educational materials. Research hasindicated that educational materials are more effective for visitors with limited experience of a site or advance information about it. Special care must be taken with the content and delivery of interpretation materials for repeatvisitors. Experts recommend that if two versions of thematerials are not feasible it may be better to ignore themore experienced audience. Visitors must believe that a given issue is real and serious, that a given action is necessary, and that they can make adifference. Materials should present an issue along withinformation on how to address it, linking visitors experi-ence with future actions. The materials could includeinformation on environmentalists clubs, other places tovisit and learn about a subject, or other additional infor-mation.

Clear goals and objectives are needed to determine what is to be interpreted, for whom and how,and who will develop interpretation strategies. The crucialstep of identifying fundamental messages and targetaudiences is reportedly the weakest link in the process ofdeveloping interpretation concepts and themes. Materials should focus on the type of visitor whose behav- iour is considered most in need of change. The messageshould clearly describe the critical problems and recom-mended behaviours. The most effective educational campaigns use a combina- tion of methods tailored for particular user groups andmessages. They are based on specific visitor profiles cata-loguing age, background, interests, origin foreign orlocal, degree of skill in the activities the site offers, specialneeds, form of access to the site road or waterway, pub-lic or private. Profiles also take into account whether vis-itors are on their own, in couples or families, or part of anorganised group. Interpretation criteria may change with societal changes such as shifts in ethnicity or local education levels. Suchshifts may necessitate new messages, perhaps in differentlanguages. An exhibit should satisfy the expectations ofoccasional tourists as well as those of local residents andrepeat visitors. Layered signs offer detailed information in smaller print intended to pique the interest of repeatvisitors. Studies show the need for careful analysis of visitor inter- ests. Many people visit World Heritage sites out of a gen-eral interest in heritage. Most visitors to World HeritageStrategies and Solutions to Tourism Management Problems 7WH  manual1-ch7 311002 1503 Page 7 70sites have little specialist knowledge or interest the particulars of a castle or other historical site are of sec-ondary importance.

Experts warn against a tenden-cy to produce new programmes rather than re-examineexisting ones, leaving no arguments in favour of one orthe other. The easiest and most common way to evaluate the effec- tiveness of an interpretation programme such as an exhib-it is to assess its ability to attract and hold visitorsattention. In this case an exhibit is judged on how manypeople stop and how much time they spend lookingandor reading the exhibit material. Staff intuition con-cerning attitude change is generally reliable and can con-tribute to assessment studies. The target audience may be reached in various ways, depending on the type of materials used. In general, visi-tors who must rely on public transport or a service pro-vided by the site management for access to an area is acaptive audience. Staff can inform visitors of park regula-tions and provide safety advice and orientation pointers. To encourage return visits, exhibits should be changed regularly, or special exhibitions should be staged on occa- sion. The Royal British Columbia Museum in Vancouversaw a decline in annual visitation because the exhibitsremained unchanged through lack of funds. Revenues declined as a result, compounding the problem. Guides can be invaluable in imparting educational infor- mation to visitors. In large tropical rain forests, for exam-ple, tourists unaccompanied by an excellent guide mayspend long periods without seeing any wildlife. Eighty to95 percent of travellers to rain forest lodges in one regionof Peru reported being unsatisfied with wildlife viewing.

Once materials raise visitors attention, the most effective method for changing behaviours is to add personal con-tact. For example, walkers are more readily convinced notto use stoves when rangers inform them face to faceabout regulations, reinforcing a strong educational cam-paign. Simply erecting signs saying fuel stoves only isfar less effective. In the absence of rangers, guides can be trained to pres- ent interpretation information. Workshops for commercialtour guides could cover low-impact techniques and othermanagement issues. Local guides at Nan Madol, a SouthPacific island with an important archaeological site, arecrucial in educating tourists and controlling graffiti andother forms of vandalism. Interactive interpretive programmes show great promise. Participatory exhibits are more popular than static displaysand are highly effective in changing visitor behaviour.Active participation seems to foster a positive attitude,especially when combined with a rewarding experience.Interactive techniques giving opportunities for feedbackinclude despatching roving staff or placing them at fixedpoints to provide information holding conferences or dis-cussions offering entertainment events such as puppetshows, plays or musicals, or organising activities such asmaking and measuring things, games and re-enactmentsof historical events.", "tokens": 345}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_134", "original_index": 134, "content": "Publications, signs, self-guided activi-ties, visitor centres, audio-visual devices, indoor and out-door exhibitions such as walks, drives and snorkellingtrails in marine parks are less interactive -- but less time-consuming for staff. Hands-on workshops may be coupled with field trips and observational tours. One scientist-teacher from PuertoRico recommended that coastal ecosystems are bestunderstood through field trips during which participantscan question and interact with the expert. The TropenMuseum in Amsterdam offers a programme in which peo-ple can seek advice from experienced travellers about cur-rent events in a particular country and various cultural dos and donts. Authentic displays based on economic activities using real artefacts and materials are increasingly popular. At theNational Fishing Centre in Grimsby, England, for example,former trawler hands recount their experiences to thepublic and encourage participation by instructing visitorsin knotting fishing line. Heritage centres increasingly offerauthentic experiences through imaginative interpretationsof local history. Since the 1980s, old established muse-ums, thanks to new technologies, have been offeringentertainment as well as education, blurring the distinc-tion between the theme park and museum experience. Oral history is a particularly useful research asset and an important source of interpretative material.

Including the voices of local people in interpre-tative programmes gives them a central role, encouragingpopular support. 7.6 Offering incentives for practising certain activities 7.6.1 Visitors may be redirected through scheduling.

Extending a sites opening hours may dependon whether resources are sufficient to pay staff for theextra time. The extra expense could be offset throughhigher visitor fees or increased publicity. 7.6.2 Providing or not providing infrastructure for certain activities can influence the type of activitypractised. Strategic construction and siting of infrastruc- ture can encourage the use of certain areas over others.Signs can promote one site over another, while removingsigns can discourage use. In areas where there may beconflict between different user groups or where separat-ing the groups could enhance the visitor experience, low-cost infrastructure development could encourageseparation. For example, signs could direct campers awayfrom areas used by day visitors. 7.7 Changing types of activity through regulation 7.7.1 Regulations limiting activities andor the way they are practised can radically affect ecological andsocial impacts. Some recreation activities producemore impacts than others. The types of visitor activities can be limited. For example, banning off-road vehiclesand motorcycles reduces soil erosion, as does the use ofhorses. To limit traffic and pollution problems, Bermudahas adopted a policy of not recognising foreign driverslicences, making car rental impossible. Similarly, non-resi-dent cars have been banned on the Italian islands ofCapri, Ischia and Procida. To minimise negative impacts due to encounters between tourists and whales at Glacier Bay, Alaska, authoritieshave set limits on the number of cruise ships entering thebay and issued regulations for maintaining a minimumdistance of 400 metres between ships and whales. Whale-watching regulations are also in place for local guides atViscaino Bay in Baja, California. Once again, such regulatory measures require sufficient resources to implement.

To address this problem, culverts can be dug alongside roads to prevent vehicles from leaving them. 7.8 Changing the sites social environment by reducing visitor conflicts 7.8.1 Separating conflicting activities reduces con- flict. Allocating specific activities to certain areas helps reduce conflict between different types of visitors. For example, groups such as snorkellers and sports fishermenwould conflict if they tried to use the same areas. Theconcept of separating user groups is related to theRecreational Opportunity Spectrum. A key issue whenusing this technique is to ensure that the different areasfor different activities remain in good environmental con-dition for the long term. Visitors and tour operators couldbe informed that if an area allocated to them is damaged,they wont be offered an alternative area. 7.8.2 Developing interpretation and education pro- grammes in close cooperation with the communitycan help to avoid alienating local people who mayotherwise feel their cultural identity is being mis-represented. The feeling of sense of place and the strong spirituality and identity which traditional people have fortheir land is not easily conveyed to visitors. For the localcommunity, memory, attachment and symbolism areoften of primary importance. In contrast, visitors mayseem to diminish local values by being attracted to theunfamiliar, exotic and picturesque. Interpretation and edu-cation programmes, when developed in close cooperationwith the community, can help prevent a devaluation oftraditional local values. 7.9 Distributing benefits to communities affected by the site 7.9.1 Locals are more likely to participate in conser- vation when it is associated with an improvement intheir standard of living.", "tokens": 363}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_137", "original_index": 137, "content": "Managers at Ujung Kulon National Park in West Java in Indonesia report that localincome-generating activities in tourism, resource manage-ment and protection encourage local support for parkprotection and conservation efforts. Environmental con-servation and education programmes alone will notachieve results. In Gambia, West Africa, the local commu-nitys acceptance of the new Kiang West National Parkwas based entirely on the expectation that they wouldreceive a portion of the economic benefits of tourism. However, increasing local benefits -- for example, by pro- viding training for local guides -- does not necessarilydraw people into conservation and protection activities.Experience has shown that conservation and economicdevelopment should be linked. Thus guides should berecruited who have an ongoing interest in conservation or community participation. Evaluations of local guide train-ing in Costa Rica indicated a need for a comprehensiveselection process, in search of both talent and environ-mental and community consciousness.Strategies and Solutions to Tourism Management Problems 7WH  manual1-ch7 311002 1503 Page 9 727.9.2 Experience has determined that community tourism projects are sustainable when people investtheir labour and savings in them.

A communitys expectations of economic benefits are often disappointed because of inadequate local condi-tions. For example, foreign tourists may demand stan-dards of accommodations and food beyond what thelocal community can immediately provide. Thus, localsmay not begin to see direct economic benefits until cer-tain basic problems are addressed. Gradual implementa-tion can exacerbate the problem, as people becomeimpatient for the economic benefits. Such problems may be mitigated when other income- generating programmes are carried out concurrently andthe community is not oriented solely towards tourism. Forexample, many projects at protected areas include agro-forestry and other resource development programmesthat can produce economic benefits such as crops andwood lots for firewood. Such options can lessen the needfor more rapid tourism development. 7.9.4 Tourisms potential for benefiting locals is a function of the existing resources and skills that canbe used to generate income. Community tourism pro- grammes should start with an evaluation of localresources and skills with which activities can be matched. For example, in many instances local transportation sup-port is needed for tourism activities, or local knowledge isin demand because of difficult terrain, such as atCorcovado National Park in Costa Rica, where groundtransportation to the park is difficult, and flying is moreexpensive.", "tokens": 305}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_139", "original_index": 139, "content": "Other activities that may need local guidingand transportation skills include mountaineering,trekking, sport fishing, skin diving, and horseback riding.More specialised activities such as bird-watching and riverrafting usually require more education and training.Opportunities for these activities often depend on theexistence of government or NGO training programmes,and tour operators who are interested in involving localpeople.Directing Benefits to Local People Through Employment Opportunities When Indias Keoladeo bird sanctuary became a national park, new regulations prohibited wood collecting andgrazing, severely affecting local people who depended onthe parks natural resources for their livelihood. To offsetsome of these impacts, tourism is being encouraged as analternative source of income. Keoladeo, located withinthe Golden Triangle tourist route joining New Delhi,Agra and Jaipur, is one of Asias most popular naturalsites, with 125,000 visitors per year, 70 percent fromwithin India. With its large population of migratory and resident birds including Siberian cranes, Keoladeo is on the list of attrac-tions of many specialised tour operators. To take advan-tage of the tourism opportunities, the parks deputy chiefwarden has devised a creative strategy to generate localbenefits. Transportation and interpretation are providedby 108 rickshaw drivers and 98 naturalist guides. Motor-less boats are also maintained and driven by a permanentstaff recruited from adjoining areas, providing anotherlocal employment option. In addition, 60 percent of thepark staff is drawn from villages adjoining the protectedarea. The park advertises for rickshaw drivers in the localnewspaper. Drivers are given three months of training inthe parks natural and cultural history as well as that ofthe local communities and tourist areas. Authorised rick-shaws bear a yellow metal permit.

Recent years have seen ashift to recruiting from unemployed low-income groups,particularly young people from rural areas. About one-third of the guides are from the surrounding communi-ties. Initially guides were required to be English-speakingschool graduates, but Hindi-speaking guides have beenaccepted given that 70 percent of the visitors are domes-tic tourists. Seasonal financial problemsAlthough daily revenues for rickshaw drivers can be sub- stantial during the peak season at Keoladeo, when visita-tion drops in line with birds migratory patterns only afew of the drivers can continue to work.

The success of the scheme dependson transparency, with the different players having well-defined roles. 7.9.5 Labour costs should be realistically evaluated when analysing community potential.

Tour companies and hotels tend not to use local guides. In some countries and in spe-cific protected areas, they are required to use under-skilledlocal guides, which they often see as a financial drain. This problem may be mitigated through intensive training of local guides in language and interpretation skills.Guides with better skills are more readily accepted bytourist businesses. As tour operators and governmentsrealise that site protection and the health of the tourist trade depend on local support, they begin to see that it isin their interests to support the hiring and training of localpeople. 7.9.7 Raising site revenue to produce local benefits. The costs and benefits of infrastructure and high-techsolutions should be reviewed in light of the goal of pro-ducing local benefits. Planners at the Copan Maya Ruinsin the Honduras realised that luxury hotels tend to belocated away from population centres, limiting opportuni-ties for locals. Noting that most domestic visitors havemodest financial resources and prefer local accommoda-tions, they recommended upgrading existing infrastruc-ture and related services. They also deemed thatconcentrated, modest, but good quality tourist facilitiescould provide many more benefits to local communitiesthan high-class, high-cost hotels, restaurants and guideservices. Such services often use outside labour, are con-trolled by outside capital, and are intentionally locatedoutside local communities. High-tech solutions to management problems should not be adopted without a serious review of their costs, bene-fits and applicability on the ground.", "tokens": 387}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_142", "original_index": 142, "content": "In some countries where unemployment is already high, these measures canput even more people out of work. It may be advisableand just as effective, for example, to use local labour tobuild and maintain palm thatch roofs to protect stoneartefacts from deterioration instead of using chemicalcompounds. By the same token, power lawnmowers areobviously more efficient than manual labour for cuttinggrass, but lawnmowers need spare parts that may have tobe imported. Visitor fees can generate benefits for both protected areas and local communities. Most studies on protected areamanagement recommend government policies authoris-ing the collection of fees to offset costs. Fees can becharged for admission to parks or monuments, and fordifferent activities such as diving and trekking, and foraccommodation and rescue services. User fees are equitable because the people who use the site pay for it. Fees for public areas such as parks or muse-ums are kept low to permit access to a greater cross-sec-tion of the population. To capture more foreign exchangeand increase revenues, some sites charge a higher rate forforeign tourists than for nationals e.g., 5.25 for foreignvisitors and 60 cents for nationals at the Copan MayaRuins in Honduras. In countries where such a two-tier sys-tem is illegal, donations can be solicited from foreigntourists and tour companies. It should be noted that achronic problem for many sites that collect fees is that themoney is returned to a central treasury and does not goto site operations. Experts report that the tourism industry may resist visitor charges even though visitors may be willing to pay morefor entrance fees. Visitors tend to accept fee increases ifthey know the funds will go to site protection and con-servation.

Common conces-sions include food, lodging, transport, guide and retailservices. Concession fees and royalties can generate sig-nificant income at highly visited sites. Since concessionfees are generally low relative to overall profit levels, busi-nesses may be willing to pay higher fees. Longer stays may raise revenue and still keep visitor num- bers manageable. The availability of an array of visitorservices can increase the average length of stay at a site.At Copan, setting up an interpretation programme,installing new trails and a visitor centre, developing pri-vate guide services, and offering after-dark audio-visualprogrammes in the nearby town all helped increase aver-age visitor stays.

Amassing information on usergroups causing problems e.g., day users as opposed totourists staying for longer periods, etc. will help to focusefforts. When evaluating possible actions, considering the various indirect and direct methods available can be a usefulprocess. Valuable input can be obtained by reviewing thesites goals and objectives during discussions with staff andadvisory body members while considering the scenarios thatcould result from different strategies and actions. Begin bydiscussing indirect strategies such as education and inter-pretation campaigns. Then go progressively to direct actionssuch as enforcement, fines, permits, and so on. Indirect actions may be adequate initially for addressing problems that are not immediate, for example, when apotentially dangerous area need not be closed, or visita-tion is not increasing too rapidly. The effects of the meas-ures can be evaluated before more restrictive measuresare imposed. A site with limited staff and financialresources may be unable to afford anything other than indirect actions. Actions should be combined for best results. For exam- ple, an information campaign can be combined with arecreation opportunity spectrum ROS plan that separates users. An education campaign can encourage disparateuser groups to practise their activities in separate areas.For example, mountain bikers can be recommended goodtrails and asked to avoid areas used by bird-watchers.

Stakeholder partnerships foster dialogueeither with a group causing a problem or with groupsaffected by a problem. These groups can be shown theneeds of the site and the reasons behind certain policies.The tourism advisory board is an effective mechanism forinvolving a wide range of stakeholder partners in visitormanagement issues. Also, future regulations need publicsupport if they are to be implemented successfully. In general, at natural sites with limited resources, strate- gies that concentrate visitors should be encouraged.Dispersal strategies should be avoided unless sufficientresources are available for educational campaigns and regulatory controls. If there is a need to open an area for a new user group, for example, a new trail for mountainbike riders, then at the very least, a friendly, non-con-frontational dialogue with the new visitors should bestarted. At cultural sites, dispersal may be effective with enough staff to ensure the protection of resources. Involving stakeholders in management actions can aid the implementation process. Hotel owners may be willingto help implement certain educational programmes, dis-tributing information on low-impact practices to users.School groups may contribute manual labour. Staff mayhave contacts with the media and launch education cam-paigns with the assistance of this stakeholder partner, dis-seminating news of site management polices andactivities.

In addition,many of the skills and materials involved overlapwith those used in interpretation programmes. 8.1 Promoting a site to help finance man- agement operations 8.1.1 A portion of visitor fees should be set aside to help finance promotional activities. This will start the cycle of attracting additional visitors, thereby generatingincreased revenue for operations. A mechanism should beset up for retaining a portion of the earnings. This will cre-ate the necessary incentive to promote increased visita-tion. Even with such a mechanism in place, some sitesmay need outside funding to begin developing promo-tional materials international organisations can beapproached for such assistance. 8.1.2 The site manager should decide which type of visitors to target in a promotional campaign on thebasis of the sites policy and management objec-tives. Certain types of tourism fit a sites goals and objec- tives better than others. As with any management action,promotional campaigns should reflect the sites stated pol-icy vision statement and objectives. For example, at natu-ral sites, if local economic development is an objective,managers may wish to promote bird-watching or trekkingwhere local people may be hired as guides or drivers. Atan archaeological site affected by theft of objects destinedfor trafficking in stolen art, a promotional programmemay be designed to attract better-off visitors who are will-ing to pay an extra fee to support an artisan cooperativemaking high-quality replicas of objects at the site.

Distinct segments of consumersmight include those belonging to museum associations ororganisations for the protection of wildlife. Identifyingpeople with similar motivations and needs enables themanager to pinpoint the types of promotional materialsneeded. A simple example is an elderly target audience,for whom promotional materials can be in larger print andmay list special services for senior citizens.To be selected for management action, a market segment must have three characteristics  it must be measurable,  it should be easy to reach through promotional distri- bution systems, and  it should promise increased earnings sufficient to more than repay the costs of targeting it with promo-tional materials. 8.1.4 Knowing how tourists inform themselves on a site they wish to visit will help identify where tofocus promotional efforts. For example, since most eco-tourists wishing to see polar bears in Manitoba,Canada, seek information from travel agents, the sitesmanagers are wise to send their promotional materials totravel agencies. However, since few travel agencies areable or willing to stock the full range of availablebrochures and are ill-prepared to deal with specialisedinquiries, a more efficient approach may be to sendagents a brochure and then contact them personally tobrief them on the sites attractions and the logistics ofreaching it. 8.1.5 Developing a theme using a sites central message for the parks promotion helps developmarketing and promotional materials.

An independent pro-motional organisation representing the different interestgroups may provide a solution. Such a group can analysea sites tourism market and management realities. It hasthe further virtue of being independent, so that it canbridge gaps between competing interest groups. A group such as an NGO with ties to the site and that knows the tourism business, or a government group witha mandate to coordinate all the stakeholders could playthis role. An independent organisation set up to facilitatetourism and park promotion at Lake Baikal, Russia, pro-duced a guidebook giving the names of local tour opera-tors and guides, and distributed it in North America,Europe and Japan. If an outside organisation is solicited, it must be given clear direction so that its output reflects the sites goalsand objectives. For example, if a goal is to support localentrepreneurs, such as ground operators, the organisationmust ensure that it promotes both smaller local operatorsas well as larger or regional and national companies. 8.1.8 Developing a sites tourism identity is an essential element of a promotional strategy. This identity, which is based on the sites goals, objectives andmarket potential, becomes associated with the site in theminds of potential visitors.

These canall be useful sources of free publicity for the site.

They can be mailed to national tourism offices, included in promotion-al information sent to tour operators, newspapers, maga-zines, radio and television stations and distributed tohotels. However, unlike other types of promotional mate-rial, brochures are costly to produce, and should bedesigned to remain valid over a long period of time. Mostpeople who receive brochures read them. However,research has found that brochures are likely to exert more influence on people who have not visited a site before andless likely to attract repeat visitors. Compiling a Brochure 1.The size and layout of a brochure will depend on its purpose. For example, if the brochure is to be distributedinternationally it should be formatted to the internationalmailing standard of 21x10 cm and be produced on light-weight paper to save on postage costs. If the brochure isto be displayed on racks at travel agencies in the UnitedStates, the standard size for a brochure is 4x9. If it con-tains a map or other practical information for the touristvisiting the site, it should fit into the pocket or handbag.Larger formats may be used if the brochure is not formailing but, for example, handed out at the site. A verti-cal design with three outside panels opening to threeinside panels is the most common. 8Promoting a Site 80WH  manual1-ch8 311002 1505 Page 4 32. All artwork, photography and titles should be designed to catch and keep the readers attention. Use short,colour ful but honest phrases to describe the communityand its attractions. Emphasise main points, for example,the best preserved remains of Moghul inlaid ornamenta-tion, or 12 kilometres of beautiful, well-developed andeasily walked forest trail. 3. The brochure should briefly describe the sites attractions and points of interest.", "tokens": 447}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_156", "original_index": 156, "content": "If nearby attractions can enhancevisitation to the site, they should also be described. 4. If the brochure is to be displayed on a rack, the head- ing should be at the top of the front cover. If there are nophotographs on the front cover, a subheading will inducethe potential visitor to read other panels of the brochure.For example, a brochure could be entitled Royal ChitwanNational Park with the subheading, A WildlifeParadise. All headings, subheadings and text must becarefully written to produce an effective brochure. Theway in which blank spaces, photos and drawings areincorporated is very important. It is useful to solicit severalopinions before deciding on a final format. The backpanel of a brochure usually contains detailed informationsuch as the names and addresses of local hotels as well asother tourism services. 5. The front panel should catch the attention of the target audience, projecting a favourable image of the destinationand stimulating a second glance. Unsuccessful brochuressimply list attractions. Instead, a destinations unique sell-ing points should be highlighted, with particular marketsegments in mind. Photographers, designers and text writ-ers as well as managers should coordinate their efforts sothat the text complements and accentuates the photos.The brochure should be truthful about conditions and sea-sonal changes, as tourists may be disappointed if they visitduring the off-season on the basis of photos showing asite in the most favourable conditions. 6. A brochure need not be exhaustive a collage of small photos usually will not help the reader grasp importantfeatures of a site. A formal, authoritative tone is also tobe avoided. Destination advertising is not usually readfrom cover to cover like a novel. People usually scan theheadings, glance at the pictures and read the captionsbefore deciding to read the text. 7.

Contact addresses and telephone numbers should include international dialling codes and include over-seas offices, if applicable.8.2.4 Contacting tour operators directly is a useful means of interesting them in a site. Tour operators are always on the lookout for new attractions to sell to theirclients. Operators, particularly companies that specialise inactivities offered at the site, will appreciate receiving abrochure and any information about the local community.Direct contact with tour operators bypasses travel agen-cies and improves the chances of a positive response. A Sample Visitors Guide A pocketsize visitors guide to Indian sites in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada, describes businesses run bynative communities and entrepreneurs, as well as partner-ships between native people and non-natives. The guidealso contains information about related attractions thatare not necessarily Indian-run, such as museums. It givespractical advice on where and how visitors can enjoy posi-tive encounters with Canadas aboriginal culture. 8.2.5 Producing an information package to area attractions and services can help direct benefits tolocal residents. If one of the goals of a sites tourism pro- gramme is to benefit local communities, a multi-lingualcommunity guide sheet may be a valuable promotionaltool. It can direct visitors to neighbouring destinations andattractions, providing a detailed picture of what the areaoffers, including dining, shopping and accommodations.The information is especially useful for attracting the inde-pendent traveller. Such a package should be distributed tokey points such as hotels in major cities and at nationaltourism offices or embassies abroad. If a site has internet,it can be distributed electronically.", "tokens": 364}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_158", "original_index": 158, "content": "A guide can also beused as a management tool for bringing about desired vis-itor behaviour, by for example discussing cultural rulesand taboos and good conservation practices. Such a guidecan be produced by the community with the help of sitemanagement. A local NGO may provide free computertime and translating services. Selling the guide even if it isvery simple may help pay for future copying expenses. Outside Financing Programmes The tourism industry has shown growing interest in financing site management activities, through pro-grammes such as the new UNEP-WTO-UNESCO TourOperators Initiative. Increasing opportunities are likely toarise to involve tour operators in financing World Heritagesite management efforts. As a result, site managers are encouraged to suggest to the World Heritage Centre initiatives for visitor manage-ment and tourism a record of these could be presentedto tour operators seeking opportunities to fund WorldHeritage projects. Promoting a Site 8 81WH  manual1-ch8 311002 1505 Page 5 A 10-page guide which can be easily and cheaply copied may be all that is needed initially. The copy should bestored on a computer, so that the guide booklet can beeasily updated whenever necessary.

The day can be sched- uled to coincide with a cultural celebration at the site, orit could be a yearly event held to mark the beginning ofthe tourist season. Tour operators, hotel owners and gov-ernment officials who belong to the sites advisory groupcan be recruited to play a role. These stakeholders usuallyhave press contacts and may be interested in obtainingmedia coverage of their activities or businesses. National tourist offices sometimes organise familiarisation tours for travel writers whose expenses paid by the gov-ernment or large tourist enterprises. To get a site includedon a familiarisation tour is not easy, but the manager mayapproach the tourism ministry or perhaps a hotel chainwith promotional materials. If no outside funding is avail-able stakeholders may be able to offer or raise financialsupport. If foreign press are invited, local business peopleare more likely to contribute time and resources to theevent. Familiarisation visits for the international media are most successful if the journalists invited have special intereststhat match the activities of a site, such as the theatre ormarine protection. One method of identifying appropriatejournalists is to find their by-lines in the internationalpress. 8.3 Implications and recommendations  A review of policy goals and objectives will give directionto a promotional campaign.

Do the site and the surrounding areashave enough attractions and infrastructure to appeal to amore general tourism market? Could the site serve as a day attraction that could be included in a general tour ofthe region, in which case firms interested in this type ofadd-on attraction should be contacted? Next, to deter-mine the types of promotional materials needed, existingor newly commissioned visitor data might be analysed fora better idea of market segments. If the steps in this man-ual have been followed, most such information will bereadily available. A review of segmentation data and a SWOT analysis will help managers make decisions anddevise strategies for entering these markets. If a site has few current visitors and limited funds, pro- motional efforts might begin by targeting the independ-ent traveller, notably by seeking listings in guidebooks.Independent travellers are a valuable source of word-of-mouth recommendations that will be picked up by spe-ciality operators. A mailing list of guidebook editorsshould be kept up to date so that they can be sent a newpackage of materials each year.

Tour operators can be sent a fact sheet, brochure and guide, along with a covering letter, to provide a goodoverview of what is available at the site and the sur-rounding area. The mailing should target operators that match the sites attractions, for example, firms specialisingin bird-watching. Restaurant and guesthouse owners innearby communities may be prepared to offer visiting touroperators complimentary accommodations and meals toadd to the attractiveness of visiting a site.

Bias will be avoided bystudying visitor patterns over an entire year, then carryingout proportionally more surveys during busy periods thanduring quiet periods. If this is not possible, results mayhave to be weighted statistically. The survey or interview environment should be relaxed, with limited stress and outside pressure such as by localvendors. The location, whether for filling in a question-naire or giving a face-to-face interview, should also assurea reliable sample and a sufficiently high response rate. Interviews aimed at collecting information on visitor char- acteristics can be conducted before or after the site visit. Interviews soliciting opinions should be conducted afterthe visit. Interviews aimed at determining why the visitors decid-ed to come to the site will yield more accurate informa-tion if conducted before the visit. Questionnaires seeking visitors evaluation of the siteshould be distributed at the exit. If the site has no officialexit, its natural exits should be identified throughobservation. Questionnaires may be distributed either with theentrance ticket or by an attendant. Clear instructionsshould indicate where to return the form. THE SAMPLING FRAME The target sample of a survey depends on the objectivesof the exercise.", "tokens": 438}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_174", "original_index": 174, "content": "To compile an overall visitor profile, across-section of people coming to the site should be sur-veyed. For more specific questions, the survey can be lim-ited to specific groups, for example, men carryingcameras. The sampling frame is determined by specificcharacteristics of a visitor, and a sampling unit is an indi-vidual who displays those characteristics, such as some-one who has come to the site from Germany, or a femalemember of a tour group. Interviews or questionnaires maybe given to every nth person crossing the gate. However,in order to avoid bias, guidelines on whom to intervieware essential. Surveying every 10th person may not bevalid for large groups. Interviews with visitors who volun-teer may not be representative. A sample size may be decided on the basis of a number of factors  the level of accuracy desired  the requirements of the statistical methods  available resources the anticipated response rate The margin of error depends on the size and representa- tiveness of the sample. SURVEY DESIGN Questions used in interviews or self-completing surveysmay be open or closed. Closed questions offer a fixed set of possible answers. The responses to closed questions are easily coded, andthe questionnaire format is faster and cheaper than othersurvey methods. With questionnaires, the respondent isasked to tick a box, and in face-to-face interviews the var-ious options are read aloud or shown on a prompt card.Closed questions are especially appropriate for concreteinformation about visitor characteristics such as age, sex,education, mode of transport, accommodation etc. Theycan be a discreet way of gathering income statistics. Evenwith issues that would normally elicit more than a simpleyes or no response, closed questions can offer a set list ofopinions. However, such questions may irritate respon-dents because of the loss of spontaneity. Details can belost as the set options limit responses. Open-ended questions have no fixed choices and allow respondents to express a wide array of points of view.", "tokens": 407}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_175", "original_index": 175, "content": "They are useful for assessing visitors feelings and viewsand solving mysteries such as why visitors do not visit aparticular area of a World Heritage site. A key advantageof open questions is that respondents can be spontaneousand provide in-depth answers. These can inform anexploratory phase leading to the design of a closed-ques-tion survey. A disadvantage of open questions is that theyare more difficult to code and analyse. They are also moretime-consuming to record, and the risk of interviewer biasis greater. Wording of questions can minimise bias and maximise response rates. Questionnaires should be attractive, user- friendly and require a minimum amount of time to com-plete. The simpler the questions, the less room formisunderstanding. However, the survey questions shouldnot be too general. For example, questions such as howoften, how much and how far can yield results thatcannot be compared. Leading questions and those thatmake assumptions should also be avoided. A pilot ques-tionnaire can uncover potential problems with the word-ing or content of questions and gauge the visitors overallreaction to the survey. Interviews can distinguish indiffer- ence from indecision and help fine-tune the wording ofquestions in a survey. When translating the questionnaireinto the local language, it is worth consulting with thetranslator to ensure that the translation does not skew theresult. Question sequencing should be designed to maximise the rate of response. Any interview or survey should beginwith an explanation of the objective as well as an assur-ance of confidentiality. The first questions should capturethe attention of the respondent, while sensitive questionsshould be asked at the end. Personal details should alsobe left for the end and the respondent should be assuredWH  manual1-app1 311002 1508 Page 2 Tourist Surveys Techniques and Samples 89that the answers to these are confidential.", "tokens": 377}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_176", "original_index": 176, "content": "Important questions are best asked in the middle of the surveyinter-view, and sudden jumps from one topic to another shouldbe avoided.

It has an important role in modern life and should be made physically, intellectually andoremotively accessible to the general public. Programmesfor the protection and conservation of the physical attrib-utes, intangible aspects, contemporary cultural expres-sions and broad context should facilitate an understandingand appreciation of the heritage significance by the hostcommunity and the visitor in an equitable and affordablemanner. 1.2 Individual aspects of natural and cultural heritage have differing levels of significance, somewith universal values, others of national, regional orlocal importance. Interpretation programmes should present that significance in a relevant and accessible man-ner to the host community and the visitor, with appropri-ate, stimulating and contemporary forms of education,media, technology and personal explanation of historical,environmental and cultural information.", "tokens": 353}, {"chunk_id": "activity-113-2_chunk_183", "original_index": 183, "content": "1.3 Interpretation and presentation programmes should facilitate and encourage the high level ofpublic awareness and support necessary for thelong-term survival of the natural and cultural heritage. 1.4 Interpretation programmes should present the significance of heritage places, traditions and cultur-al practices within the past experience and presentdiversities of the area and the host community,including that of minority cultural or linguisticgroups. The visitor should always be informed of the dif- fering cultural values that may be ascribed to a particularheritage resource. Principle 2 The relationship between heritage places andtourism is dynamic and may involve conflicting val-ues. It should be managed in a sustainable way forpresent and future generations. 2.1 Places of heritage significance have an intrinsic value for all people as an important basis for cultural diversity and social development. The long- term protection and conservation of living cultures, heritage places, collections, their physical and ecologicalintegrity and their environmental context should be anessential component of social, economic, political, legisla-tive, cultural and tourism development policies. 2.2 The interaction between heritage resources or values and tourism is dynamic and ever changing,generating both opportunities and challenges, aswell as potential conflicts. Tourism projects, activities and developments should achieve positive outcomes andminimise adverse impacts on the heritage and lifestyles ofthe host community, while responding to the needs andaspirations of the visitor. 2.3 Conservation, interpretation and tourism devel- opment programmes should be based on a compre-hensive understanding of the specific but oftencomplex or conflicting aspects of heritage signifi-cance of the particular place.

Preference should be given to using local materials and take account of local archi-tectural styles or vernacular traditions. 2.6 Before heritage places are promoted or devel- oped for increased tourism, management plansshould assess the natural and cultural values of theresource.
